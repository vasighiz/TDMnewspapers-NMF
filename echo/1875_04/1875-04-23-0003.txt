The Lime Kilns

Dotrolt Froo ross
A plain was put under wiy at this port
Suturdny which if successfully carried
1 ont cannot fuil to have great weight with
 the Dominion Government and it is eayi
eatly hoped may result in goneral benefit
to vessel und steamboat owners

The following proposition has been
drawn up and will be printed copies of
which re to bo sont to every American
port on the likes for signatures

Realizing from bitter experience the
necessity of amplethorough fares for vessels
through tiie natural highways of our great
inland seas and agreeing that it may be
perhaps onr duty in part to nssistin gain
mg the desired ond we undersigned ves
sel and stenmbont owners at the port of

snbmit the following proposition
to his Excellency tho GovernorGeneral
and the honorable assembly the  Parlia
meni of the Dominion of Canada hoping
that some getion will ensue resulid 1g in
the early and complete removal of the

 

of the tairs and felt 80 brimful of battle  oLstruction to the navigation of Petroit

River and the lakes known as the Lime
kiln Bock

1 That an estimnte of the cost of the
removal of the Limekiln Rock be made

Tue variety of kisses introduced in the  by a committee of two civil engineers one

to be appointed by Pmrlinment and the
other to net for Anierican vessl owners

2 That n committee of arbitration

consisting of four persons to be chosen
by Purlinment and vessel owners whose
duty it shall bo to decide upon the por
tion of the cost of the proposed improve
ment to be paid by American vessel own
ers i 
81 That bath parties agree to ho do
 cision of the arbitrators which decision
 be accepted as soon as reported and
that upon its acceptance operations be
commenced at ns early o date as possi
 ble towards removing the obstynetion to
 be carried on under the superintendency
of engineers to be appointed by his Ex
 cellency the GovernorGeneral
 The above Pepasition brief nnd to
 the point it is hoped will receive the sig
 nature of every vesselowner aronnd the
inkes or if it fails in hat it is hoped
will awaken sufficient interest in the mat
ter to call out propositions to gin the de
sirnd end from parties intorested both in
the Dominion and our own country In
 view of the almost imperative demand
for and the comparative i ficant cost
of tle improvement in question together
 witls the benefits to be derived by all it
 will be very strange if something does
 nut result from thie action taken yester
 day which will be the means of clearing
 away before another season of navigati m
is pyer the post of the rivers so long
