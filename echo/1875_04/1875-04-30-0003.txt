Weights and Measures

 Mr Davis Inland Revenue Inspector
the other doy received from the Dopart
ment at Ottuwaa complete set of weights
and measures manufactured to the order
of the Canadian government by Oertling
the famous bullion balance  moker of
London England and intended to be
used as standards in this country for the
timo to come Tho mechanixm of the
whole is superb and the adjustment ab
solutely perfoct The measures are turn
od out of solid brass and range from
half a gill to the Imperial gallon Each
measure is supplied with o polished glass
disc with a small aperture in the contre
for the escape of nir The rim of each
measure is 60 exactly smooth than when
covered by the disc tho escape of air
between the metal and glass is impossible
In measuring distilled water is used and
is poured into the vessel until the brim
is renchied when the disc is slid on and
nearly over the top and mmall quantities

 yf tho liquid graduslly added throngh
aperture on one side of the rim until

every particle of air is forced ont and the
water reaches tho glass nll round Tho
operation requires a steady hand and
 much care ta experimenting Mr Davis
found that  after emptying the on
measure and refilling it again with the
samo liquid tho vessel wonld not hold
an additional drop Tho accuracy of
the scales of which there aro throe com
plete sets is equally marvellons One
set d for testing weights trom
two to fifty pounds has its balun
anoo adjusted by intins of o platinum

 knifo the fine edge of which rests upon
a plato of the samo metal This instru
ment needs to be operated in a room
frod from currents of air The other two
scales aro sot in cases as the alight
eat draught would sway nnd render inac
curate the balance The Iatter portion
of one of them rosts on an agate blade

Will you be kind enough to allow APACS
for a fow remarks in reference to Wator
Works  Communitios like individuals
nre slow to move perhaps much slower
than the majority of individuals on ne
count of the diversity of thought and
opinion as well as of interest and it is
only when some severe disaster has ocour
rod that unanimity of fooling to resist the
common foo compels ns it were corpor
ations or communities to spond a little
money for the protection of their own
property os well as that of their neigh
bors AB Wo are very much in need of
an effective systom of water supply both
for fire and domestic use this I doom is
one of the principal pressing necessities
felt and of deep interdst to ench and
every inhabitant of Amherstburg We
annually spend about 5000 at a low es
timate for the paltry supply and not the
Quosest of water that wo are compelled to
0 gatisfiad with for domestio purposes
when BY an expenditure of about 10000
and probably less we would be placed
beyond all fear of a conflagration that

 may atany moment at the present fine

pot the town out of existence and have
an abundant supply of pure water in
every house There are buildings on
the government reseryg hotter known as
the Asylum Grounds one of which would
answer the purpose that could no doubt
be negotiated for without much ox
pense and converted into an engine
room whichis all that is required for
