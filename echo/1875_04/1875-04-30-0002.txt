Verse vp 5

Whon the first wave of the gold excite
mont broke over the country Amou drop
pod hishoo and started for California wil
the expebtation of making an immediate
fortune  

Joel being more  deliberate Serna a
home rding hia brother ag an ot
Wous snthusinst and his undertaking n

 chimerical one 

From time to time letters were received
from the absent brother giving glowing
descriptions of the country in which ho
was making his profighe sojourn Sover
al times Joel was on the point oF Joining
him but he could not persuade himse
that it would bo wise to spend go much
anonay ua it would require in making the
journey that after all might prove a futile
one

One while driving the cows to pas
ture u pe thought ocourred to him
Ware there not rocks and precious miners
oly all around him Had anybody ever
undertaken to discover anything of the
kind Forall he kuew tho rock upon
which he was standing might conceal no

old mine He determined to investigate
the matter at once

Ho resolved to carry on his work with
the utmost secrcoy No one must soo him
and snateh from him the golden secret
hs was determined to discover He ao
cordingly procured a picknxe and crowbar
nnd taking his gun he sought the most
inaccessible ledges aud ravines and be
gun hig investigations

For soveral weeks bo continued his in
vestigations with tho utmost secreoy The
neighbors noticed his strange behavior
and wondered greatly at his conduet
His work upon the farm was neglected
lie grew moody and absentminded and
not u fow of his acquaintances intimated
that there was surely somethin
with him

Early one morning he started out in o
dew direction After croming soveral
deop ravines and penetrating two or three
mileginto the woods ho came to a high
ledge where ho began his labors He
hnd been busy about ten minntes when
his picknxe detached a bright fragment of
rock He picked it up in sarprise The
sunlight iin it it glistenod nnd spark
led with marvellous brillinney It was
gold  gold  aoLp 

He was almost overcome with joy Lie
rubbed his hands across his foreliend like
ono who disbelieves the ovidence of his
own senses It was soveral minutes bee
fore he realized the extent and impor
tance of his discovery After proceeding
with his investigations he found a wide
deep vein of the yellow metal that extend
ed along the face of tho rock apparent
Jy without end

Ho was richthe saeret was his no
body could wrest it from The greathope
of his life was accomplikhied With
the wealth he could commmandho could
buy the whole town yes oven the whole
county if ho desired it He snopped his
fingers contemptuously at those who hand
been accustomed to pass him by without
notice

He secured several of therichest speci
mens he could find and after concenlin 14
all evidence of his work he secreted his
bar and pickaxc and went excitedly home
ward

Every one whom hie met noticed his
strange behavior though he tried hard to
appear indifferent and unconcerned und
almost before lie was aware he found

limgelf the talk of the whole neighbor
liood

Tlint night he could scarcely sleop
He turned and tossed upon his pillow
and if by chance he fellinto a slight doze
Newas sure to start up with the belief
tliat he was being crushed under a huge
lump of gold or that some similar mish
was about to befull him Hoe awoke with
o burning fever and it wus soveral days
bofore he was able to get out Ho kept
his precious socret Ho hardly dared
to ste for fear Lie might reveal it in
his dreams He would not run the risk
of returning to the ledge for fear some
person might follow him  there

After many cautious inquiries ho ns
ecrtained that the ledge belonged to Miss
Sally Winterberry no hatchotfaced old
maid whoo exact age nobody could find
out The property had been left her Ly

 her maternal grandmother nnd it had
never Joel out of her hands because it
seemed fo be of no possible use or value
to anybody

Miss Sallys surprise may be woll un
derstood when sho was cautiously op
proached by Joel Tobin whoin a round

about manner proposed to purchaso her
et of wild land

 

 

g wrong

Hor curiosity was ex
citedin a moment Sho knew there was
somo deeplnid purpose in the mine of Joel

 

Tobin with regnrd to that land and
therefore she told him she could not think
of parting with it a

 But gnid Joel Ill pny you two
or three times its worth ore aint
nothing mean about me fohow 4

Poople aint in the habit opaying
two or three times what things are wo
not if I know myself noid Miss Sally
with a significant nod 

Joel colored nnd staommered and hur
ried away leaving Miss Winterberry
more puzzled than ever

Ho went to soo Nahum Kingsley the
village jeweller and calling him 0 the
back of the store Joel mysteriously drew
from his pocket tho specimens be had
secured Si ol g tho yellow metal be
fore tho astonished Nahum he said

What dye call that

Why Gold of course

  
 
  
  
   
  
    

  
    
 
 

ho enid with naton
you want to
y walk g Iii silence together
At last Joel spoke
Sally ho said hesitatingly dont
u lonesome sometimes that is
Toot you ever feel the need of na
some one to sup ou you know
No I dont I onan support myself
I rockon I dont mean to come on the
townnot if I know mysolf

But Sally you aint so very oldthat
in Ive soen worse lookin women than
you are in my timo

Humph  Thats what the fellers used
to say whon you were a hoy sighiog
but its all right I guess i

By this time they had arrived at the
gate where Sally stopped and made a low
ourtay 

Much obleeged ho said

Jool took lier hand and  proussed it
Sally thought to herself What can oll
that monn I wonder 

Sally enid Joel evidently in ernest
Will you marry me 2

She dropped his hand ini surprise and
before he could muke an explanation
anid 

When 
Tomorrow

Joel Tobin she exclaimed are you
really in onrnest 

Sally Winterberry I am

Joel went home and dreamed all that
night about his groat discovery Sally re
tired but no rest Was she really to
have o husband after all und a young and
goodlooking ono too Was lie even in
his right senses  Sho tried2to persuade
herself that he was

Tho next day they were married The
community were taken wholly by sur
priso ns much so as Sally had been at her
unexpected offer Joels mother shut her
self up in the parlor bedroom and refused
to hold any intercouse with the numerous
visitors that cnlled to congratulate her
upon the possession of n new daughterin
Inw Farmer Tobin sent for his son and
in a towering rage demanded to know
why he had made such a fool of Limself

Drawing the shining specimens of the
yellow metal from his pocket Joel said 

Ldok o there

Well whitt of it 2 

Do you know what that is 2

Well I should think likely

You dp 

Why anybody ought to know It
crops out all over the farm I used to
think it was gold when I wns a Boy

 But aint it gold 2

 No u

 What is it I should like to know
snid Joel beginning to grow pale

Its a kind o iron sumthin  it nint
worth a straw  but whats the matter 2

4 Oh nothin T thought it was gold
 thats all
Joel went to California ghortly after
 Whether he found a gold mine there or
not I am unable to eny He never ro
turned to his native town to claim his
newlymade bride  Evcexe J HaLy
