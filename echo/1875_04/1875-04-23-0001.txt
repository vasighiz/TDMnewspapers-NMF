Friexns of peace and humanity will be
glad to learn that tlie German army
which hos only numbered 1826600 men
can by the process of a new law bo made
to reach 1000000 men The French
have only 1080400 men but lope tp do
better How much more advantageous
to civilization if these two and a half
millions of men now arming to cut ench

Tue Mail says Mr Justice Wilson gave
judgment on Wednesday on the points
raised by the scrutiny of ballots He
held that all the crosses marked to the
right of the candidates names were good
whether within the eompurtment set off
for them ornot In this decision he fol
lowed English rulings and has dissipated
a very common error entertained in Can
adn Not necessarily cither he said did
the fact of thio crosses being put elsewhere
than to the right of the names invalidate
the ballots  ho wasinelined to hold them
allgood where it was apparent that the
voter did not make a mark for the pur
pose of being identified

THE TOWN HALL BYLAW

On Monday evening lust a byliw was
introduced at the meeting of the Council
toraise the sum of 10000 for the erec
tion of a now Town Hall and Market
Place for Amherstburg Tt vas rend no
first and second time and will go before
the peaple for their sanction on the 27th
day of May next The bylaw provides
for the issuing of debentures payable in
ten years nt does not state where the

wo think is an important omission and
should at once barectified Although the
timo fixed for the payment of the deben
tures is rather short still the amount
required to pay the interest and provide
a sinking fund will not amount to over
1800 por annum and will be more
than wet by the increased value of pro
perty avithout increasing the rate of tux
nition We hear of some opposition to
the crection of a new hall on pegount of
tho proposed location but we lope peo
plo will not bo so foolish as to oppose a
public improvement because they can
not havo it located at their own doors
Others soy that the now Catholic Tem
perance Hall will be sufficient for all
purposes but wo would remind them
that it is controlled by private parties
and will only be available for such entex
toinments as thoy may think fit to limit
it too We question very much whether
balls theatrical performances or minstrel
shows would be permitted to be held

 

therein We lope that another public
meeting will be held during next month
and that a full discussion of the bylaw
 will bo hind before it is voted upon
