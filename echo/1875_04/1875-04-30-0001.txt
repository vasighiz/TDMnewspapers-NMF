COASTING LICENSES

 

There having been some doubt as to
whether a late statute did not annul the

order in council permitting Canadian

 vessels to trade with foreign ports on

the inland waters of the Dominion on
taking out a consting license and that
they had no option but pay the usual
charge of 50 conts or 81 according to ton
nage each timo they cleared inwards or 
outwards application was made to the de
partment of Customs by Collector Andor
son of this port for information on this
point and an answer was reesived from
the department last week The Com
missioner states that the Minister of
Customs has decided that vessels having
n consting license aro not required to pay
clearing and reporting fees even when
making n foreign voyage The Cousting 
Regulations ns amended permit vessels
having a license to make voyages o a
forgign port but of course they must in
such cares roport inwards and ontgrrds
in the sume way asany other vessels but 
withgut being subject to foes  Hereafter
ju granting coasting licenses the old
bonds willbe used but the new form of
Hocus Wille adopted oxit is n decided
improvement on the old one giving as it
does a detailed deseription of the vessel

THE NEW POSTAL RATES

 

A circular has been sent out from the
Post Office Department to Postmasters
in reference to the new Postal law from
which we learn that after the first of May
publishers of newspapers may obtain a
permit from the Postmaster General
allowing them to take immediate advan
tage of the provisions of the new law and
prepay all their papors at the rate of one
cent per pound bulk weight or any frac
tion of a pound weight All such papers
must in evidence of prepayment bear
the words Prepnid by Publisher on tho
address to distinguish them from those
posted under the ordinary regulations
Papers and periodicals so prepaid by pub
lishers are to be delivered to the persons
to whom addressed without further
charge for Conndian postage Propay 
ment by Publishers is optional till the 1st
of October next after which date it will
bo obligatory The one cent per pound 
rate will apply to newspapers posted by 
publishers to regular subscribers or news
ngents in the United States on and after
the 1st of May Tho rate for transient 
newspapers and periodicals posted in
Canada and addressed to the United
States willbe one cent per for ounces
or fraction of four ounces which must be 
prepaid by postage stamp Newspapers 
and periodicals posted in Canada and 
addressed to the United States weighing
less than an ounce each muy bo posted
singly ota postage rate of half a cent
onch which must in all cases bo prepaid
by postage stamp

As most of the subscribers to the Eono
have no doubt paid the postage om their
newspapers up to the 1st of July maxt
tho publishers will not take advantage off
the law till that date after which they
will prepay the postage on all papers for
which subscribers Lave paid thgir annual
subscription
