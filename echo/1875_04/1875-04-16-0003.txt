Aud now Ah she thinks therenre
heavier blows than death can strike
And tho poor crushed spirit wanders
from the dead Willie to the living sorrow
of her life nnd thon ene thoughts of
God Perhaps Ho would pity ber He

of her mother teaching hier Our Father
Thus diverted from her griefs and sooth

Sugar Beet Culture



A fow of the more enterprising ngri
culturists of this section saftor consider
able enquiry into the matter have resoly
ed to practically test the question ns to
who ther the soil snd elimute of Essex is
apapied to the profitable growth of beats
for the manufacture of sugar In other
parts of Ontario as well as in the West
tern Statosa good deal of capital hasbeen
invested in beet root sugar mills genor
ally with satisfactory results notwith
standing that being a new interprise in
America the best kind of roots for the
purpose and the system of cultivation
and after treatment were but imperfoctly
understood in Europe especially
Frafice sugar making from the beet is
very common and exceedingly profitable
It is stated that the French manufacturers
can afford to sell a firstcluss article
quite equal to similar grades made from
the cane at five orjsix cents per pound
Most people who have given athenght to
the subject are of opinion that Essex is
better suited for the growth of sugar beets
thop nny other portion of the conlinent
andifso its cultivation must be attended
with profit and should not longer be
neglected If good crops could be got
the erection of mills would follow as a
matter of course We would urge all
the farmers who can spare a smull picee
of ground for the purpose to plant it 
this season with thie seed of the best 
beet as an experiment The more who 
try the more thorough and satisfactory
will the test be In any event the timo
will not be thrown away as the crop is
about ns good  ono as can be grown for
food for stockRecord



Laxp RonLersThe roller is a niore
valued implement thaw formerly  Qur
improved farm machinery demands
smooth surfuces on the fields Then for

can be done with a smooth surface

ploughing means easy after  tillage
and clear crop The roller is need
