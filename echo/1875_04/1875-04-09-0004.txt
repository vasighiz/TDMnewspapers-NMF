Thoy further stated that they had an entire

A lotter wos algo read from Mr A W

Col Rankin was present and addressed
tho Council on the question of the Canada
Southern crossing the Detroit River by means
of a bridge at the head of Bois Blane thus
passing throughs the town Ho said that
some Retion should be taken by the Council
to present the advantages of such  crossing
to the shareholders of the Sonthern Road in
England and elsewhere as thero was no
doubt some better method than tho present
for crossing the Detroit River would have to
bo obtained the present season and doubtless
an effort would be made to have the crossing
sum distance kboe the present one The
probability was that the directors and share
holders residing in England werd kept in
ignorance of the adyantages to bo gained by
tho Companys building a bridge from this
town to Bois Blane He laid a chart of the
River before them and proved the entire
practicability of sneh a bridge being built
from n short distance above Thomass Mill
in this town to thy head of Bofs Blane Islnd

 

BC

rate the cost of building the connceting lines
from their present line on this side through
this town aud then from Bois Dlane to
Grosse Islo again on the other side together
with the bridge wonld notzbe much over one
million dollirs  There was little doubt that

 

rectly during the past winter would fall
littlo short of this sums Now the town

having the Southern cross at Dols Blane
that it was to their interest to use overy



ondenver to accomplish such an end and 

they should sceure the services of some com

 holders Heo himself might procesd
power to impress on them the advantages of
building a bridge from Amherstburg to Bois
 Blun The expense would bef very little and
 they even if they failed would have the
 Batisfaction of knowing that they had lost
no opportunity of seeking to advice the in

terosts of their town In reply to some
 members of the Council ho anid that if they
held a specinl heeting this week he wonlil
como down necompiniod Ly Mr Scott Civil
Engineer of Windsor who would Iny bufore
them a plan and specifientions together
with the estimated cost of building such a
bridge

Cel Rankin procoeded further to lay
before the Council the plan of a Hotel n the
Swiks stylo which he proposed recting on
Bois Blane Island during the present sum
 mcr if the people of this neighborhood con
sidered it would be sufticicntly ndyantageons
to them to take an interest in it Tho
ercotion of such a hotel and cottages os he
 proposed would cost about 15000 and the
buildings would accommodate nearly 100
visitors If the Council and people of Am
herstburg desired 40 assist in its erection by
giving a respeotuble bonus he himself and
others woulll invest the balance required

The Council decided to hold no special
meoting this week to take into consideration
and endorse a series of resolutions to bo
prepared by Col Rankin embodying the
past experience of the Southern Raila
with their present crossing and setting forth
the advantages to theroad and town of o
crossing at the head of Bois Blano Inland
which resolntions are them to bo for sanded to
the bondholders of tho Railway along with
tho engineers report
 Thuy will also at tha tmeeting tako into con
sideration tho advisability of granting a bonus
or otherwise assisting in tho crection of the
proposed hotel on Bofs Blane Island

Tho Town Hall question wns brought up
and after a short discussion Mr Morin gave
notice of his intention to introduce nt the
