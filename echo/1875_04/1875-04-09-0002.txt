fitting a square of red patchwork and in
tently observing the effect

Nonsense Mary Yon know what

al very well for you to keep putting it
off but I cant stand it What witli your

In the drawing of a breath she Lad
prished Timothy Marehnll into the square
pendulum ense of the tall old clock and
turned tlic key on him It was pot a
pleasant place of refuge inasmuch as his
shoulders were squeezed on either side
and lis Jiend flattened against springs
and wheels above and the airy was wa
pleasant and close but Tiny made the best
of the matter and shook with suppressed
laughter in the solitary cell

Well a jolly scrape to le in

however and I cant do better than to

With a heart that beat quick and fast
she drew the key from lier pocket and
proceeded to fit it into the lock So ab
sorbed was she that she never noticed the
cogsation of breathingnover saw the
Deacon start into wakefulness and logk
around him Love is blind and it 1s
equally true that it is deaf The deacon
rome quickly with un shrewd twinkle in his
eyes and Mary gave a frightened shriek
as o hand fell softly on hor arm possess

 Let me help you he said

 Father 1I Lave found the key
she faltered
