advantage to wus if a bonus of say

from conversations wo havo had with

feel cortnin tht wo cnn by offering
pome inducement have their boats enll

the Southern Railway Company will
soon find it to Le to their interest to

Some Post Office Rules 
Nover buy any postage stamps Hand
your letter to the PAL and ask him i be
cun change a V if ho onit tell Lim youll
hand it to him somo other time It will
not bo necesrary to do so however as thres

cunts are nothing

When you hand your letter to him do not
by any moans forget to toll him to be sure
und havo that go If you do not give him
this warning he will bo very apt to keep iy
in his office a long time

Always remember not to put your lottery
in the letter box If you do tho ppstmast
or will not have so much buaipesp apd you
encourage laginess

Tin well to ask him how Jong before you
ought to got apn anuwor to it Of course ho
cant toll hut just to seo how ho can guess

If yon have a box do not call out the num
berof it but stand and dram on it with
youy fingers This will enable you to show 
that you have got a box and oblige tha i
postmaster to take a good look at you 

When he hands ont your mail if there is
any dont fail fo ask if thats all Post
mastorerou know are in the habit of hold
ing back a portion of puch ones mail which
of courne they will not do after this question
in asked

If an expoptod letter or paper does not
comp ask the postmaster whit ho supposes is
the reason and toll him its mighty curious
Qf course Josten nro npt possessed of
supornatuml kpawledgo hud thoy sbownld
Jnpw where tho lotters are after they have
been in the business awhile Tis well to
toll the P M abont expecting a letter where
from and what about in story is apt to
rander him good natured if ho is busy and 
you once in a while hint that it must be in
tho office somewhere 

If tho man of the house doen not gol any
mail its well for him to send the regs of the 
family to the offico one at a time Thay 

 

         
         

might have better luck He must tell ea

to nk tho Postmaster if hes gure there aint
nothing
