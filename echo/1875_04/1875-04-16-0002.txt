LAKE SUPERIOR STEAMSHIP
LINE

Tho Windsor and Lake Superior Line
may now be considered a reality as on
Tuesduy lost tho ratepayers of Windsor
voted by 284 to 63 nearly five to one to
grant Mr George Cumpbell and the gon
tlemon nssociated with him a bonus of
6000 upon their entering into ap pgree
mont to establish and keep in operation
for three yoars n weekly line of stenm
ors from Windsor to Fort Edward and
Duluth Lake Superior  There is no
doubt but that the line will bo of immense
benefit to Windsor as thero is on large
and constuntly increasing  froight and
pssongoer traffic to Manitobn and thers
must also bo a great trade built up in
connection with the Pacific Railway
about being begun  Mhe experience of
other owns like Sarnia and Colling
waod inlinving such lines of boit has
been of so beneficial a oharactss Haat our
only wonder is that thera Were found
ony citisons of Windsor forlith enough
to oppose the passing of the bonus by 
law The Record soy

for mpnufivetaring purposes should the
line betome a reulity Efforts oro in

and othe important structures Now
if tho benefits of this steamship line
are to be 0 greatly in favor of the

comes 0 question whether Amherstburg
could not By some means participate in

ahippod ab this port to the grest North

 Wostus 105 hrbor tao  cannot be oxa

colled on the whole ohinin of lnkes
Although we would assuredly not
with all due deferonce to the Records
statement grant the sum of 6000 to
have the ling call lero and ply regu
larly between Amberstburg and the
Northweat it might be of considerable
adyantage to us if pn bonus of say
1000 wero granted them on conglition
of their culling at this portin fact
from conversations wg lave had with
somo of the promoters of this line we
feel certain that we eun by offering
some inducement have their bouts call
Should the however refuse to
onll there is little doubt but tliat
tho Southern Railway Company will
soon find it to Lp to their interest to
have two or thros firstclnss boats ear
rying freight and passengers between
this port and the head of Lake Superi

never stand still and see their trade

Some Post Office Rules 
Never buy any postage stamps Hand
your letter to the PM and ask him if he
cun change a V if ho cant tell him youll
hand it to him some other time It will
not be necessary to do so however as threo
cunts are nothing

When you hand your letter to him do not

by any means forgot to tell him to be sure
and have that gol If you do not give him
this warning he will be very apt to keep if
in his office a long time
 Always remember not to put your letter
in the letter box If you do the poatmast
vr will not have so much buaipess apd you
encourage laginess

Tis well to auk him how long before you
ought to get an apawer to it Of course hn
cant fell hut juat to seo haw ho can guess

1 you have a box do not call out the num
ber of it but stand and drum on it with
youy fingers This will enable you to show
that you havo got a box and also oblige the
postmaster to take a good look at you

When he bands oat your mail if there is
any dont fail to nskif thats all Poat
masters you know aro in the habit of hold
ing backn partiem of each ones mail whicly

of course they will net do after this question
is asked

If an expoptod letter or paper does not
come ask the pastmnstor what 0 supposes ia
the reason and tell him its mighty curious
QI conrso tpaktord are net possessed of

supernatural kpawlodge but they sh
by tnd tho letters aro after er in

been in the business awhile Tis well to
tell the P M about expecting a letter where
from and what about in story is apt to
rander him good nat if ho is busy and
Jou once in a while hint that it must be in
the offico somewhere  x

If the mon of the honso does pot Rod any
mail its well for him to send the regt of the
family to the offico ono at a time Th
might have bitter luck He wust fell ea
to ask tho Postmaster if hes gure there aint
