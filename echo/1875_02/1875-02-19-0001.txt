NEW TOWN HALL
The fecling among the ratepayers in
regard to a new Town Hall is generally
favorable ns ham been to somo estont
proven by the petition prepared nnd
presented to tho Council within a few

call a meeting of the Ratepayers to dis
cuss the quastiion some time next week
when if they express themselves favorably
inclined towards the scheme a bylaw
will be at onew introduced for the purpose
of enabling thie Couneil to raise tho nee
essary funda by way oflonn The desire
seems to be fo retain the hall on the site
of the presen one which is centrally
located and iri thit evont nearly all the
materinl in the old building could be
utilised fox thonew one While consider
ing the erection of the Hall we hope the
question of a suitable market ground in
connection therewith or near by will
not be lot sight of We hope soon to
hear the matter fairly disenssedl in all

its bearing Ly tliose most directly intor
ested

Lingt yoor ST7805293 af tho debt of the

The balance from Insg years frant was

The merchants and all other citizens of
the Town of Amherstburg will be glad to
Jearn that another enterprising business
man is about to take up his residence
nutongyt us in the person of Mr Charles

of GW Girdlestone  Co Forwarding and
Commission Merchants of Windsor  On
Wodnesdny Inst as will bo seen by the
report of the Town Council proceedings
n a of the Richmond Street dock was
granted to that gentleman for the period
of ten years certain privileges in connec
tion therewith being resorved to the
town In addition 0 the town
dock wo beliove Mr Girdlestone hos
leased My Twomeys ndjoining and the
two combined will give him 128 fect of
frontage on the river the town dock hav
ing 40feet frontage and Mr Twomeys 83
feet It is the intention of Mr Ginlle
stone to proceed at once with the erection

on the town doek
which will b 5 Toot The time
ber is now g got ont to put the dock
in proper order and work will bo begun
on it next week so that it may bo all fin
ished nnd ready for business by the first
of March An office will also Do built on

  

 tho wharf for the transaction of business

and as goon as the river opens Mr Girdle
stone will begin to purchinse main of all
kinds and will ati tho stone ware
Longe on Twomeys dock for storage till
its removal Thus our farmers will
soon have on market at their doors ngain
without going ull the way to Windsor
Mr Girdlestone has obtained tho local
ngency for the steamers Dove and Bob
Hackett which will call at his wharf for
freight ind passengers instend of farther
down the river as formarly and he will
also represent nofiistclass Montreal and
Chicago line of steamships He has

tern Railway Company for a special
freight rato ovar their line from Toronto
Humilton and London to Windsor and
thence by boat to Amherstburg thus giv
ing our merchants equully advantageous
if not superior and more satisfactory ac
commodation han they have hitherto
been accustomed to by rail as well ns water
He will be enabled to lay freight down
here at ns heap a rate as can be done at
any other town in the province Mont
real freight will be delivered by water at
20 cents per owt MrGirdlestonehas been
promised the support of many merchants
and there 8 no doubt he will obtain a
fair share of the business of the town
and a little keon competition with others
We are
sure all will welcome him or any other
live business man to onr town and in
thus sending one of hier active citizens to
assist in building up Amherstburg
Windsor is but beginning to repay the
heavy debt she owes us for furnishing
her with threefourths of her most
