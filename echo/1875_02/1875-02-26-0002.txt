Protection on Railways

Last week Mr Mackenzie brought
in ap bill fo prevent railway accidents
which is RIL of several emallor
bills with a few important additions
Although necidents through the in
toxication of employees now rarely occur
in Canada temperance being now the
rule on our railroads notably on the
Grand Trunk still itis worthy of the
efforts of Parlinment to provent the
occurrence of even an exceptional cx
Itis terrible to think of a train rushing
on with its living freighy and having its
fate in unsteady hands guided by an
alcohol poisoned brain The fixst section
of the act providep that any person who
 during the time when lie is on duty as a
pointsman or sectionmanwhen inatten
tion or error on Lis part might involve
Yosh of lifesor propertyis dyunk or in
toxicated shall boo deemed guilty of a
misdemeanour and any Company em
ploying persons who hase been convicted
of such misdemeanour or who are known
by the Company to linve been intoxicated
or habitually addicted to tho use of in
toxicating Liquors shall ineur a Doudiy
of 2000 Another clause of the Act
makes provision for  safe means of com
munication between passenger cays
Many lives are lost owingto the wide Qe
tance between passengers cars it requir
ing a leap to get from one to the other
It is deemed advisable that cars bo so
constructed that it will bo impossible for
persons to fill between them and also
that the sides of the platform shall be
protected by a railing Another section
 provides that the doors of railway cars be
constructed so that thoy shall bo easily
closed and opened both from the inside
and outside The accident on the Great
Western Railway near Komokn shows
the necessity there exists for some log
islative notion in this direction Tt shall
provide farther that the provisions of the
Actin not to free or etonernio any Compy
from liability by their failed to make ad
ditional provisions for the safety of pass
