THE ASYLUM G

Woe aro this week authori
that the Minister of the In
promised to sell the Asylum
the spring or early summer in fair sized
lots by Public Auction to the highest
bidder The terms will ba onefifth
down the balance in four equal annual
instalments with interest hos also
decided to charge the town on hundred
dollars per acre for five acres onetenth
to be paid down and the balagee in nine
instalmentss Mr McGregor our mem
ber ondonvored to gesedhe Govornmont
to make tho town o presoub of the five
ncres for a purk but 0s aT Ho
mnny places buying Ordnance

Lands ab
the present time sueh ad Quebec Mont
real Kingston and

oronto where they
are very valnablg and where in almost
overy case the Town or City is applying
for them the Ministry have considered
that the loss to the country would be
too great as they could not grant
them free in one ease without doing
80 in all the others Colonel Coffin
has reported that the building
md ten acres should be used for a
Seamens Hospital but the ten acres sold
off in lots would bo of more value to the
town than a hospital with very few
patients and we hope his recommend
ation will not be adopted We shall bo
able to announce the time of sale
definitely within thie next month

PUBLIC MEETING

A gin be seen by notice in another
column the Reeve in response to two
petitions of ratepayers has called a pub
lic mooting for the Town Hall at 7
oclock this evening to discuss the ques
tion of the ercotion of a now Town Hall
and the granting of bonuses to manufue
turers A good deal of discussion has
taken place among the ratepayers on
these questions during the past few days
and we expect to hear them both debated
in an exhaustive manner  Some few
oppose the erection of a new Town Hall
preferring to support the granting of
bonuses but we think that on further
ccnsideration of the matter they will seo
that the Town is well able to provide for
both schemes nt once No one who has 
ever boem in our Town Hull hut con 
demns it both ps inconvenient and 

dangerous ahd suy linkering of repair
 ing that could be done to it would only
bo a waste of money without at all
improving its appearance or eafoty As
tothe granting of bonuses very little
objection is likely to Le taken and we
are sure that if somo such indycements
are offerod we can hinve two or three new 
factories in operation in eur midst the
coming summer Wo understand that one
gentleman hins offered to establish a car
ringe factory pormanently employing 25
men if he receives a bonus of 1000 but
as such a factory might couflict with in
terests alrendy established his offer will
lLinve to bo ocurefully omnsidercd before
action is taken Wo hapo the ratepayers
will turn out in strong forze tonight
and thus manifest the interest they fool
in the material welfare of Amhersthurs

 




In the estimates for 187576 the Gov
gramoy pave allowed an amount for
cleaning out the Lime Kiln crossing
above the town which will be of some
advantage at present As it will take
