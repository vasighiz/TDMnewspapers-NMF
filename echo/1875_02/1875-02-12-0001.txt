THE C 8 CROSSING

The immense loss directly to the Can
nda Southern Railway Company and the

serious injury to tho permanent triiffic of
the Road enused by the mmforiunate

River The present winter must lead to
some very material change being made
he coming summer The tunnel pro
jeot bins been revived and we beliove a
strong effort is being made to organize a
company to build one here but while we
believe this will be by far the best solu
tion of the present difficulty and will tend
 to ceniralize the whole through trade of
  west nt this point it will necessarily be
 some timo before it can be completed
Meantime some other and better cross

other ferry steamer that may be built
and we are sure from all the information

 ter place cannot be found than directly
through Amberstbury and across Bois
Blane Island The oldest residents of
this meighborliood say that no diffieulty
has ever been experioneed in keeping the
river apen from tho head of Bois Blane
Island to the lake ns the ice is always

48

blocked at the upper ond and very little

coffort would be required to keep the chan
  nel below quite free as the current and
denp water worlds carry ofall ice that
could be formed There i8 o largo air hole
across the ol 1 nearthe foot of the
18 never been kpown to

THE AMNESTY QUESTION

The Government hinve announced their
policy on the NorthWest question in the

kenzie of a sories of resolutions which
recapitulate the whole history of the
YS  affair with tho letters written by Sir
an amnesty held out to the offenders iy
him and Sir George E Cartier They
 recite portions of tha evidence taken be
fore the NorthWest committee of last
session and the dealings of LieutGover
 nor Morris with Riel Lapine Father
Richot aud Archbishop Taghe during the
Fenian Raidand also at the time of Riels
retirement from the Provenchercontest
in favor of Cartier

nl

tho econclnding resolutions i

That from tho gail evidenco it further
appears that Sir John A Maedonald
First Minister nnd Minister of Justice
pave assurance to Archbishop Taghe his
Quebico collengues and others that he
would on his intended visit to England
press on Her Majestys Government to
take up the question thinking thatthey
might seo their way to granting a eom
plete amnesty without the Canadian Gov
ernmont being responsible for it to which
ho had no objection and whieh would he

believed bo loyally neeepted by the
Canadian people

That in the opinion of this Honso it is

not for the honour or interests of Cannda
tliat the question of amnesty should re
main longer in its present shape
v That in the opinion of this House the
facts developed in the said evidence can
not be ignored by the people or the
Parliament of Conndn and must be con
sidered in tlie expression of their views
os to the disposition of the question

That in tho opinion of this House it
would be proper considering tho said
facts that a full amnesty should be grant
od to all persons concerned in the North
West tronbles for all acts committed by
them during the said troubles saving only
3 Riel A D Lopino and W B0Dono

ue

That in tho oplnion of his Hongo it
would bo proper considering the aid
foots that o like amnesty should be
granted to L Riel and A 1 Lepinecon
