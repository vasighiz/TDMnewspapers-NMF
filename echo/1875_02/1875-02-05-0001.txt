in his power to bring onr town and its ad
vantages prominently before the public

To show what other towns are doiug to
increase their importance we quote from
the St Thomas Times 

At 0 meeting of the 8t Thomas Board
of Trade on Friday evening last an offer
was made by Messrs Pincombe  Mar
tyn of Strathroy grain merchants and
millers to erect a flouring mill in this
Town rt a cost of 20000 and have it
in running order by the 1st of Anguat
next provided the Town would give
them a bonus of 5000and exempt them
rout daxation for five yesrs They
propose to erect the mill near the tenck
of the Cannda Southern Ruilway that it
ahinll have four run of stones having in
connection therewith a cooperage ie
 whole oneern giving employment to
Plagion to submit to the 4 81 or B0 men They would manufucture 600

o muy discharge the duties for sev  grain for abippinz r
eral countios witra the busimress admits  20mbe paid 90000 for groin iu Strathroy

 Tivi ond the mill he proposed erecting here
of an arrangement of this kind Ii view  Gould bo farger than the one at that
of this policy the judgeships now vacant  place
will probably nat be filled up a present
and DeputyJudges are likely to be nam

ter to ruise the sum required for fle cree  1st week the Eono rma fi LL shinre

number of yenrs If we are never to get to keep n littlo nearer the truth When
rid of this parsimonious  penny wise and hie rofers to his neighbors and he will not
pound foolish policy what hope can we be likely to have hii toes trodden upon
linve of seeing Amherstburg taking her When he nsserts that the Ecno comes
proper position among the towns of On ont strongly for o protest against Mr
tario Wo liope a public meeting will be Wigle he simply asserts what is Gitrue
called and the views of the ratepayers  when he gays we must be actuated by
ascertained on this important maiter malicious feclings against Mr Wigle he
  talks arrant nonseuseand whon he winds
up by volunteering the information that
any hopes that Mr ler may have of tak
ing the seat ara all moonshine we would
inform him that however mneh bis serib
Uling may have done to elect Mr Pattor
on in the North Riding it Lins not nor is
it likely to lave any weight with the
roading and thinking people of South
Essex nshe might as well begin and tell
us that the moon is made of green cheese
os mannder in the way he is at present do

issue he attacks the Sherifffor not fur

lazy to go and obtain for himself ns his
sotemporaries have done We cau os
sure him nll the returnswo ever received
in this or in say other clection were not

Couneilprepurd themselves for real work but always as in this case linve we gone
when they meet at Sandwich and hold  direct to those parties and asked foe them
an evening session like many other bodies  when they were given without hesi

DESPATCH OF BUSINESS

The length of time required by the Bs
sex County Council fo transact the
amount of business brought before them
at ench session link now becanie  subject
of general remark and in truth we must
say that seldom have we seen so much 
time required to do so little ren work
us the County Conneil of Essex has con
sumed at the last two sessions  At the
last session the business which required
five duys to transact might casily have
been fined wp in two nnd thos
saved to the County a sun of 120 be
sides being o great advantage to those
members of the Comneilehaving business
requiring their constuit pttention Why
do not the members of the Exsex County

 

MANUFACTORIES

While other towns are offering every
possible inducement to maumficturers to
loente in their midst we should be no
lagsards in the race bat ever on the
alert to add to the wealthy population and
consequent importance of our town hy
seeuring the seitlomoent here of those
hives of industrymamufactories  With
our fine situation on the great water
highway and the shortest railway route
from the great west to the Atlantic sen
board every fucility is offered for the
shipment to all parts of the country of
goods manufactured here There ore
many branches of industry which suzgest
themselves ns being oapable of being pro
fitably carried on in this town  There is
no renson why the manufacture of Fuxn
ture for instance hould not be made 
paying business here os elsowliere as
there is an abuadant supply of suitable
lumber within ensy reach and at prices
much below what it ean be obtained nt
in towns where such fictories nro now be
ing carried on We believe every ono
will readily admit the untold benefits
dircet and indirect to covery town in
which manufactories exist that in fact
these are what build up towns and give
them a standing in wealth and influence
But to mercliants and trndesmon the
