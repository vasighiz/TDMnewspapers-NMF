conspiracy and unparalleled atrocity At
Ho mo of the ie of the Swedy
there was much excitement in Utal

 

Brigham Young was then Governor ofthe
territory and Superintendent of Indian
Affuirs The polioy of the Mormons was
to monopolize the country in which
thoy had sottled nsing every means to

revent ts not their own

whon other devices failed the Mormons

wards used by a family of Mormons
After Inying in thoir supplies in Salt
Lake City this party proceeded toward
California and that  was tho last that
was known of them fora long time
From facts which subsequently came to
light it socms that the party
three hundred miles from Salt Lake on
tho rond to Los Angelos in a beautiful
meadow five miles in longth and one in
breadth affording an exellent resting
ground They intended to romain in
camp some time in order to recruit their
stock before enlering upon what was
then known as the Great Desert While
thus encamped according to the com
tuonly accepted story of the butchery
they woro attacked by Indians employed
by the Mormons for the work und by
Mormons disguised as Indians Ton or
twelve livss were sacrificed before the
immigrants comprolicnded their danger
he remaining members of the party at
once seized their arms aud returned fire
Sheltering thomselves behind their wag
otis with tho women and children lying
in the trenches they had dug the immni
grants kept the enemy at bay Socing
uo other way open for their triumph the
Marmons resorted to strategy Tho ir
fing by the Indians ceased und the be
sieged party looking up the meadow
suw o wagon full f mon coming toward
them These men proved to be John D
Leo and other Mormon dignitaries who
offered to medialo with the Indians
The immigrants on the recommendation
of the Mormons who seemed to bo act
ing in good faith surrendered their arms
and stock to the attacking party and
agreedito return by the road they Game
the Mormons promising to give them
safe conduct until thoy reached the sot
tlements  Maving been relicved of their
arms and stock the emigrants started
Morthward on foot  Tho womoir and
children were in front tho men followed
und in the rear was a guard of forty Mor
mous Hardly had this sorrowful pro
cession started on its way when a fire was

poured into them from an nmbusli fol

owed by an attack from the Mormons in

thorear and in a fow minutes 120 men
women and children lay slaughtered
upon the ground Sovnteen of the
yonugest children were saved and adopt
od into Mormon families and itis said
that threo men escaped immedinto death
But one of these was aftorwnrds murder
ed by the Indians  another starved fo
death aud the third was killed upon the
Colorado  though by whom it is not
Jnown

Tho evidence so far adduced at the
trial of Leo goes to show that this ne
reount of the mnssacroe is substantially
correct An exbishop of the Mormons
Philip R Smith wlio appeared as States
evidence gave a full description of the
slaughter with all its sickening details
and also told of tho deliberations of the
Mormon leaders which preceded the
butcliery in which against his will as
Le says ho wus forced to participate
The massacre was resolved upon by Mor
mon bishops and counsellors Lee and
W H Dame being among the most con
spicuous in planning and executing the
crime The description which Smith
gives of the slaughter fully confirms all
that has heretofore been roported of its
barbarous character Whether Justice
will now overtake the surviving perpot
Tators of this atrocity remains to bo seen
It is doubted whetlier tho present trial
will result in tho conviction of Leo and
his ansocintes since eight of the jurors
are Mormons  while it is eid that some
of them are near relatives of persons who
axe deeply implicated in tho murders
