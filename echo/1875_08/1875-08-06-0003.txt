Tre Waar Season ar CuarmasThe
wool season here having about closed
perhaps a fow figures in connection with
the sales to several of our local buyers
will not prove uniuteresting Our figures
may not andprobably do not include all
the wool elip of this section but we think
thoy will embody the bulk of the wool
purclinsed in Kent and the names we
give are the largest purchasers in tho
County Mr Grandison Dyyds purcha
ses will amount from 85000 to 40000
i Messrs Taylor  DBrungers
ully 20000  Mr Charles Willinms 13
000  Messrs Geo  Jno Stringer jr
10000 and Mr David Smith 10000
The average price paid was 85Jc Those
who havo sold have not got much if any
over 86c per 1b By these figures the
wool dealers have not made much by
their speculations and the farmer has
evory reason to bo satisfied with the re
sult of his labors In Michigan wo see
that tha top prices paid in the interior
towns were from 85 to 49 Am cy and
oir exchanges from there say that eleven
twelfths of the wool is marketed and the
balance is nearly all in large clips that
will not bo marketed until after harvest
The wool crop is estimated ot 4000000
