THE ECHO

AMHERSTBURG AUG 20wm 1876

THE ELECTION ADDRESSES
he 

The nddresses of both candidates for
the enflxages of the electors of South
Esuex are now beforo na and merit our
serions consideration Mr Tlor comes
ily and squarely to the front as the
neoof the Liberalparty and a sup
porter of the present Administration
ready nnd willing to nasist the Govern
meut in every mensure caleulnted to nd
vaneo the interests of the Province of
Ontario in general and the County of
Bgsex in particular Ho does not pro
fess to be a blind follower of the Admin
istration but while they pursue the lib
orul policy of the past four years thore is
no doubt they would have in Lim n
warm supporter Mr Wigle opens Lis 
address with a lengthy reference to the
causes which led to his being unseated
and elnims that he was fairly elected in 
Jonnary lust although the Judge Jing 
declured that lie was never elected Mr 
Wigla claims to represent a politicnl
party nlthough what party ho does not 
mention in his whole address  Ho 
claims to bo untrammeled by party and
that he will give the Government an in
depondent support in good mensures
always of course allowing himself to be
tho judge of what aro good and what are
bad measures  From the address of Mr
Wigle it is plainly apparent that he con
siders himself certain of receiving the
vote of the Conservative party and finds
it necessary to secure his election to
make a strong bid for the support of the
Liberals of the Riding Wo think the
Liberals of South Essex will have no dif
ficulty in determining which enndidate
they can place the most relinnes on and
to whom they will give their votes at the
coming election

David A Wells writing in the Aflan
tic Montlly for Agimst in referenco to
tho Cost of Protection to the United
States says that the practical result of

tho exacssivgedatios on steel may bo il
Tustrated by stating that in 1872 tho
Michigan Central railroad relnid its track
at Detroit with steel rails costing nine
tyseven dollars gold per ton while at
o distance of half a mile across the Do
twoit ri ex the Canada Southern railrond
wis laying down the safe kind of rails
at n cost of sevogty dollars gold por

The picnic and demonstration to be
tendered to Arch MaKellar at the close
of lis political career will como off at
Ridgetown on Wednesday Sept 8  A
number of prominent Reformers are ox
pected to bo present from different parts
of the Province

Tlie Reformers of East Kent are called
upon to select another candidate as Mr
Duck nominated several wocks ngo hns
declined to carry out the candidature
No reason hos boon assigned As Mt
McCraney of Bothwell brother of Wm
MoCraney MP of Halton was tho noxt
ropylar candidate of the Inte Convention
wo presume he will bo selcted A von
vention was to bo held at Ridgetown
todny

Congiderable satisfaction has been man
ifosted by the organs that Mr Woods
mpjority in South Vietorin was brought
down on Tuesday from 800 in January
Int to 76 Let us look at the figures
In January Mr Wood polled 1826 votes
and Mr Cottingham 1026 on Tuceday
Mr Wood received 1004 ballots and Mr
Hudspeth 1228 In actual figures the
falling off of Mr Woods support was but
28 votes 

Ohief Justico Dorion last woek quashed
