which he did not have at tho inst election
when he only had one week in which to
press lig claims to theseat Both parties

 now bave a fair start in the race and if
the Liberal party expect to win they enn
only do it by o strong and united ef
fort and steady work maintained to the
close of the polls Mr Wigle aud the
Conservative purty are no doubt already
hard at work and no stone will be left
unturned that will benefit their prospects
It is nok likely tlt any public meetings
will bo held in the Riding until the writ
ig issued and it is definitely known when
the clection is to take place which will
probally not be before the middle of Sep
tember ns the Government consider thie
harvesting season too busyja one in a rural
community like ours to precipitate an

Lewis WioLs NOMINATED

A mooting of tho Liberal Conservative
Association of South Essex was eld at
McLeods Hotol Easox Centre on Thurs
day 20th for the purpose of nominating
a candidate in tho interests of the Con
servative party to contest the Riding at
the coming cloction About fiity dole
gates were proscut

Mr George Wilson the President be
ing absent Mr Michael Maloney of Mul
den was appointed chairman and in a
few Uriof remarks introduced the object
of the meceting alluding to the recent
loss of the sent by Mr Wigle by reason
of the act of an ngont as brought out in
the election trial

It was moved by T B White of An
irda socondud by Simson Wiste of
 ert  e the
proion oan Lo the standard
enrer of the party

No other nominations taking
this motion was unanimously earrie

Mr Lowis Wigle addressed the meet
ing and referred to the ordeal through
which he had lately passed and its ter
mination in proving thet so far ns he
was personally concerned ho was per
footly innocent He felt that it was a
proud position for him to be again called

 onto bo the enndidate proving that they

considered his acts daring the election
contest pure and in strict accordance
with the election law He was more
than ever determined that during the
coming election ho shonld do no act
whereby ho could be unseatod and he
called on his supporters to be careful hot
to transgress the law

My J O Pattorson NM P P for North
Dssox eowplimentod the moeting upon
their unanimous choice on the present
ocension and fully asreod with their deci
sion as he claimed that Mr Wiglo had
the best right to tha position having
come ont of the Inte trial clenr of all
blame and showing o steady intention
and desire 40 obsemye to the very lotter
the election law The eircumstancy
which unseated hinn was the drinking by
his brother on Pollling day which tho
Judge deemed a viokation of the law and
was compelled 8 orefore under the act
to declare the lection void The judges
decision on 0 whole was 0 compliment
ta Mr Wigle and a credit to South Essex
i being held that as a general thing coy
rupt practices did not prevail He strong
ly advised o steady and determined sys
tem of organization and of all working
with a will to secure the roturn of their
nominee

Solomon Wigle thanked the meeting
for the proud position in which they had
placed him in having a son who had
again been unanimovsly chosm ns the
standard bearer of the party It gratified
hini fo know that his son could conscion
tiously elnim their support as far 08 re
garded his condact at the late elotion
He alluded to what hoe called the trivial
charges that had been bronglit up to up
set Lewis election but all failed but tlio
ono of treating Alfred having been
deemod an agent by the court the enndi
date was held responsible and uunsented

A voto of thanks wasthen given to the
chairman and the mectivg closed with
cheers for the Queen onl Megsrs Wigle
