A POPULAR REMEDY

FOR CONSUMPTION

Bronchitis Cough Asthma Secrofula Rheumatism

HE high reputation to which this article has attained whrrants tho bollef that it
 possessed more than ordinary virtue in the treatment of many ehroniec complaints Com
bining both nutriment and medicine and boing singularly aoceplable to the stomach it may
bo nsed with advantage m many cases where debility of digestion and aystom gonerally
forbid the use of the ordinary medicines

By careful analysis it is found to be simple and mild in its charactor

 and well adapted
to oases from infuney to old nge without detriment from continued nse

It in now about ton years since I commenced to import and bottlo Cod Liver Oil 1 did
so only after a vofiy careful examination of the facts connected with its manufnctare as T had
reason to believe that a largo proportion of the Cod Liver Oil which is sold was prepared in so
careleas a manner as to render it nufit for uso The usual modo of proparing the Oil is so
wanting in ere in the selection of the livers and is conducted in so uncleanly a mannerin
mamy coses the liver being allowed to prcoyposn in order to facilitate the extraction of the
Ollns to make the product not only very disagreeable to the taste and impossible to bo
retained on tho usually deliente stomachs of invalids but also to deprive it of other qualities
essential to its full efficiency in the class of diseases for which it is usually prescribed

Sinco the introduction of my Cod Liver Ol it Lins steadily gained favor among physicians
and others Many have been able to retain it on the stomach when other Oils had dikagroed
with them and nauseated so much that thoy had to abandon their use altogether My Oil is
prono unced by many to bo the Cleancst Finest Sweetest nd mont digestible Oil in use
