requested to explain gay certain ali
cious reports about Mr Tle
him while haswas a candidate

Mr Atkin said ho had entered on the
candidature at the Inst eloction resolved
to do all ho could to win the election
and had not backed down because
ho wos afraid of Mr Wigle an he had
nover met  man in debate of whom he
was afraid nlthongh some were no doubt
better debaters than he was Tha only
thing lie complained of in Mr Wigle was
that he seldom discussed politics Ho
Atkin had held a moeting nt Verckor nt
which lie expected Mr Ter nnd he felt
rather hard about it at tho timo but
when lie found out that Mr Iler knew
nothing about the meoting he did not
blamo himns he aid not get his lefter
Ho did everything lio could for Tler with
out rogard to the reports nnd the asser
tions of his opponents that Tler was op
posed to himself Ho believed in the
present Government and would support
any one who camo out as their supporter

rs support of

contest ns warm n one as over took place
in the County Wo would nls havo the
nid of Mx Mowat and other ablo spoak
ers fram a distanco Ho urged on them
oll the necessity of naking Ilors cause
their cause He was glad to see that Mr
Iler did not wince under defent but was
ready to aguin bear the standard He
would be heard frequently during the
contest

Goro Atkin enid Mr Tler deserved
credit for the enerry he had shown in
again entering the ficld He djd not see
any reason in any one voting fop Wigle
out of sympathy if ho had any political
principle Ho was of tho opinion that
it was the duty of the Reform party to
eimduct the election in such a manner
that they noed not bo ashamed ofit The
man who was honorably defeated was
not disgraced Mr Wigle never would
nssert distinct what sido ho wns
on but hung between tho iwo His
opinion was that n man should be sent to
