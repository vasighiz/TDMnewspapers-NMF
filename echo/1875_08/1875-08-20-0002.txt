iful my small cousin 9 

 Hush Charles You must not speak
to mo in this manner

Dont look so serious little girl Yon

And Charles Maynard burst into a mor
ry laugh that echoed through the poplar
trees in tho old garden 

Now tell mo DorothyTI insist upon

Look Dorothy There lois TI will
quoto no proverbs but tho rim of his hat
turned the corner just ns I spoke Now
dont Took ns if you intend to go back to
the louse for you are not going Ti
tell you a secref When Twas down
the river this morning I found a boat with
o tempting pair of onrslying in it and I
mado up my mind that Dorothy Hicks
and her wicked cousin from Now York
wero going fof n row in that very boat

this ovening

Tt is neighbor Hancocks boat

He will lot us linve it

Y05 But Charles I fear it is my
duty

No it isnt You know you do not
want to spend this lovely evening in the
house entertaining Broadbrim and yon
do want to go and watch the sunset on
tho river with me 

Dorothy looked donbtfully toward the
houeo and wishfully toward the river

Femme qui hesite ost pordue old
Oraycont will enteh us

Chayles eatehes Dorothys arm in his
and in a moment they aro on their way to
tho shore

 But Charles sco that cloud in tho
south If there aliold bo a storm 2

The onrs are lifted into the rowlocks
Dorothy takes the liclm and goon they
aro gliding over the smoth surfaco of tho
water loaving o track of silvery bubbles
behind them It was a lovely evening
Tho misty shadows of twilight  are
gathering in the enst and a tho west
tho clouds Lloodred and purple aro
casting o rosy light all over tho broad
river  o fresh breeze is blowing round
their faces and waves plash against the
gide of tho little boat like low mondtan
OU MuBIo  

Charles is talking about his city home
and amusing hier withstories of lia col
logo days and bis efforts to make Lis wiy
in his profession which at first wero so
unsuccessful

Neither of them noticed that the breeze
grows every mowmant stronger and fresh
cr and that the dork cloud iu the south
has sprond over the horizon and is cov
cring it with darkness

Presently a low muttering growl of
thunder startles them from the dream in
to which tliey have fallen

Turn back Charles torn back

cnued Dorothy The storm is upon
us  

Dut thero 18 no turning back Thay
have been rowing with the tide Both
faces grow palein the murky light os they

It is imposible you cannot do it 2

ered 3 sud with a low moan Dorothy
sinks down from her goat and covers Ler
face with her hands

Wo will fry and land thore The
ide will not urn for an hour

The effort was successful The ledge is

aclied and Charles enrrics Dorothy to
tho Lighest rock and lays her gontly
down Lae

My love my little love lie cries
Igesing hoz helpless hands have I killed
you 

aStop I elio  oxelaims Listen

 Phere inn bontss It is coming to us
Dorothy is npon hex knees and a ory of

The Quakes with Lis stern emotionless
face wionches awny iho slender hands
that eling to Charles and clasping Doro
thy in hig arms lays her at his foot in the
boat No word is spoken till they reach
the other shore Then he carries her
to ihe nearest fisher hut 

As thoy stand within the shelter of the
little cabin Dorothy looks at him with
wild eyes and o ery of torture issucs from
Jier lips 

Go back go back You will go back
for him I

Go back for your clogant city lover
whose earclossness had cost you your life

 but for mo

Dorothy falls on her kuges and grasps
Lis colil hand Gy

Go binck  go baclk

Promise first that you will not marry
him Swear it as tho worlds people do
Then ho takes lier hand olds  up to
heaven and wails for the onth

Dorthys lips movebut no sound comes
Bho has fainted

The fisherwifo takes ho unconscious

Ephraim Ford goos upon iis errand of

Barhoeuno In Colchester

On Thursday lost a grand pionio Was
given by the congregation of the Indo
ndent Methodist Ohurch Liborty
pel ot Gilgal in Colchester A large
pe od of colored scple ssutled
ho woods just oppo 0 chapel and a
days was enjoyment was indulged in

Tho arrangements wero made by the
pastor the Rov R P Dorsoy and the
committee Jacob Banty Na Powell

and Lovi Mitchell An ox nnd several
pigs wore ronsted for tho ocension and
aby resont partook of a hearty meal at
which plenty of cold ham chicken vego
tables e were furnished by the ladies
of the congregation The proceeds are to
be applied to tho renovating and robuild
ing of the church

Aftor the dinner wns over shortly  P

after two oclock the pooplo were called
togother to Loar a number of politioal
specchos which had been promised on
the ocension by the candidates for South
Tseox and their friends Mr Josoph
Mason was appointed chairman

Dr Pearson delivered the oponing ad
dross and congratulated those present on
the liberty they onjoyed and tho debt
they oy the Toto Party for that lib

erty

Ar Tas Clark of Winsor followed in
o lengthy spooch and kept the andi
onco laughing by his oy jokes and
stories He mado an oxeollont spocch
contrasting tho Conservative and Reform

nrtios He said ho preferred the Re
orm party He preferred thom
from their past record nnd would
support that party ns they were the most
Tooke to tho perfoct Jberty of colored
people 

 Mx Tsanc Holden of Chatham was onll
od on He gaid ho had come there on
an cducationd mission not a political
ong but what hie had heard that day of
politics roused Lis old spint He did
not wish to gay anything till Mr Davis
spoke nnd that gentleman should not
slow the white fonther as he had done
agit wos generally understood that ho
Davis was tobe the orator of the day

Mr Dclos R Davis supposed they
wanted him to say something to piteh
into Ho had said ho would make a
politic speech that day on hearing
that Mr Ler had made one at Ambierst
bury but considering tho object of the
meoting ho would withdraw and say
nothing further at that time 

Mr Nasa McCurdy aid that it had been
anounced for the last few dnys that Mr
Davis would make a political speceh and
now when there was on opportunity of
dispelling tlio mists that ho sought to put
before their oyes he retired into a hole
frightoned and would say nothing

Mr Davis objected on the ground of
impropriety the time not being a pro
per one

Dr Pearson said it was not a day of
lhumiliation and prayer and if Mr Davis
lind got into doop water lio should now
wado out the best way he could

Mr Holden was astonished that a man
Jiko Mr Davis who was licensed to plead
in n Canadian Court of law should be
afraid to load ofl in a speech before a man
like himsclf who never attended a school
a day in his lifo Politics wero not ovil
in liomselves and religion should not
enfirely shut tliem out Mr Davis had
told hit rue honesty wns synonymous
with true Conservatism and ho would
like Lim to prove this lolim and ho would
git down till Lo did

Tho cliairman called on Mr Ilor and
Mr Wiglo to como forward and addross
the people i J

Mr Hier gnid he wasnot afraid to ad
dress them Ho had spoken at Ambhorst
burg by special invitation  H had been
told thnt some of the colored people had
taken objection to a position ho had as
sumed on the schgol question Ho sym
pathized with the colored peoplo und
would do all dio ronsonably could for
them Me intended fo give the Govern
ment a fair measure of support In
reference to the petition presented
Dy the coloxed people to the Colehestor
Council which Mr Davis would say
something about he would say that the
Couneil could take no action on it ns it
was not signed by thonumber of ratepay
required bylaw He could safely leave
Mr Davis in Mr Holdons hands

Mr Lowis Wigle had been invited to
address them by Mr Davis Ho was
glad to meet with such men as had al
ready addrossed them as they wore an
honor to them In regard to politics ho
would say that ho lind received the ma
jority of the honest votes of tho electors
of South Essex and Mr Iler had vin
dictively protested his election and he
was unseated beeauso his brother took
glass of alo with nn cleolor on polling

day Ho could safely leave his case to 

Dolos Davis if Mr Iler could leave his to
Ay Holden

Mr Holden said that Mr Wigloe do
sired to bo cleoted to ropresont them but
hind advanced no political principles
Ho roforred to small County Council
matters and said nothing about political
ssnes Ilo said ho Wiglo had been
once clooted but the Judge a sworn offi
oor aid ho had not and wo must take
tho latters decision What had the
building of a lockup in Windsor to do
with being elected to Parlinment Ho
howover know that Windsor required
moro and stronger prisons tlian other
parts of the County to hold villains from
tha othor side and prevent them over
runping tho County Ho was a Teform
or bbeauso ho approved of their policy
Mr Davis had neserted that truth guided
the Conservatives and had thon sub
sided that nssertion baving apparent
choked him Tho colored people owe
their boing sot apart in Separate Schools
to n Conservative Government Ho had
endeavored to lave tho law amended
under Conservative governments unkuo
cossfully Ho lad the support of the
Reformers who wero then in opposition
but the Conservative Government of
180809 had introduced a miserable sub
torfugo for tho dosred amendments
Ho agin wont to Parlinment with o
petition from tho colored pooplo of Essex
on tho subject and put it in tho hands of
Solomon Wiglo who thon reprosonted
Easox and who now stood him
That representative of their rights on
donvored to make shim believe the
timo for such petitions had passed ond
morely read it in tho House never rais
ing his voice in favor of the prayer of the
Jotiton no wan his duty rvativos

always uplield lavory but Ieform
ers opposed it Ho remembered tho timo
when colored could not live in
