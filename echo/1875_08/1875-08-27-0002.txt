widely sentterod who ooensionally shot
down some drunken desperado if his
frienda wero not too numerous but be

possesa oF

Genornfly onch separate community
liad A recognized leader somo man more
muscular and reckless than his fellows
and who by virtuo of these qualities had 
a certain mumber of followers who ware
ready fo moo that his will was the ug
power in that vicinity

Snel d ono wns Jack Dunlow Jacks
Rendqunrters were at ho station on the
overland mail routs where wo chanced to
be located for a few weeks whilo survey
ing in that vicinity and we liad a good
opportimity to witness a most interesting
incident in his experience which trans
pired while we were there

In appearance he was formidable ns
wo saw him on the morning after our ar
rival Fully six feet six inches high
with long arms and logs slightly stoop
ing witly a ponderous frame immense
masses of hnir and beard clothing i
keeping with his general appearance and
neither gvercloanly or attractive n how
ieknifo and revolvor thrust into his bolt
Jack wis certainly the man to intimidate
any person of moderate nerves

For many yearshi had been rocosmizod
ns the loading spirit in that vicinity and
from that position he had grown indepon
dent of al restraint save his own will
Ho hind  chosen band of followers who
were ready to support him in every vil
Ininous widertaking Wo wero not long
kept in waiting before some of his poculi
arities were brought to our notico

Tho keepor of the station Frank Rus
cll was a mediumsized man some forty
years of age ho had recently coma to
 the place bringing with Lim Lis wife n
 danghter and  young man who had been
in his employ several years and who was
nid to be tho nacepted Jover of the young
girk

On the morning fullowing our arrival
while the chicf engineer of our corps
wag preparing the work for the day the
remainder of our party after puting ev
erything in readiness for service disposed
ourselves abont tho station to smoke and
wait for orders While wrenthing our
selves in vapor and longing for a dny or
two of rest in strode Jack Danlaw and
demanded a dram of whisky The bos
Roeper produced the beverage and Jack
who was already more than excited by
the polations of vile Hquor which he Lad
diay twmed it down with a gurgle
Just ue he lowered the tin cup which ser
ved stead of no tumbler Core Russell
entered the room in search of her faths

Alarmed nt his brutal manner tho
azirl turned to leave the room but before

dssed Ler repentedly with his lignorfam

As dlie broke from his grasp and esonp

The flask belongs to Mr Ranney he

His shooting war all nccidental

Tarbox bit his lip and locked to the

Seeing his irresolution

Dont trouble yoursalf Mr Tarbox

The flask is mine and I will see to getting
it

You will eh snarled the bully Git
away from meont of arms reachor

Tll mash yo like a ronst tater I

Thus speaking tho ginnt swung his fists
about but the young mun did not move
Instead he received o blow upon the hond
which knocked away his hat and soemed
to change bis wholo nature to that of a
young lion With a strength and agility
wholly unlocked for he deult tho ginnt n
foarfy blow full upon the nose which
knocked him to the ground nnd deluged
the nnoomely face and beard with tor
rents of blood There was a momentary
struggle upon the ground after tho bully
fell and then Stophien stepped back a poco
or two

In a moment the ruffion was upon lis
foot again and with a foarful curse he
Jaced his hand where he expected to
Bnd a rovolver But it wns gone Then
he sought for his knife but that too was
missing The young man had taken tho
precaution of romoving them so that now
the two stood upon equal ground But
what o contrast  Nine inches in height
tho bully towered above Lis antagonist
while in actua woight Le was more than
twico Lis equal

There was no parley or hesitation
Finding himself weaponiess Jack rmshoed
for the young man and would havo
crushed him in a deadly grasp but the
young man did not wait for the process
A quick fierce blow falling just where
the other one had fallen staggered the
rosoal and before ho could see what had
become of the man he supposed alroady
in his gracy n tremendous eyack in tho
enr brought him again to the ground
Again he serambled to his feet and again
ho was knocked dowa by nsingle ro
verberating blow The third time he
arose but before he conld wipo the
blood from his eyes sufficiently to dis
tinguish his antagonist the hard earth
again became his bed

This time he dill not rigs immediately
It was patent to every ono before this
stage of the eneounter that ho was over
matched for once and at lust that fact
soomed to have become clear to lis own
mind Drawing the flask from his pockot
ho cast it upon the ground muttering
savagely 

Thars yor old flask  Tuke it if yor

 Stephen stopped to the spot where the
coveted prize lay and picked it up placing
