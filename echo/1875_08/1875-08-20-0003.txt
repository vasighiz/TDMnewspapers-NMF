Brother Bell in response among other
things said that ho could illy express in
words the thanks his heart prompted for
this gencrons consideration on the
of Frontior Lodge Ho felt that this me
mento of his post associstion with the
order and particularly with the brothers
of the lodge here indicating as it did a
mark of their worm appreciation of his
services so imporfectly yet disinterested
ly and conscientiously rendered would
form an additional inducement to merit
the continunnes of their kindly feeling
and brotherly love by regular attendance
on the meetings of the lodge and n deep
interest and solicitude in its prosperity
The benttiful regalia and jewels will al
ways hinve associated with them the treas
ured reminiscences of pleasant and profit
allo hours spent in brotherly jutercourse
which had for its chief aim the eleva
tion of moral friendship and it
would always bring vividly before him
the cheerful faces and kindly greetings of
thoge with whom it had been his happy

Tt would be
treasured for those from Whom it had
been received and should cirdumstances
over cour whichhe earnestly prayed
might nover be the case by ronson
of which he should forfeit their esteem
and brotherly love then he sould deem
himself unworthy fo Le ustodian of
their gift and shonld returs it to the
lodge to be worn by somewne more de
serving than he He was proud of the
fact thint the Past Grands of this lodge
had been constant in attendance conser
vativo in their advice and took a promi
nent part and deep terest in the work
and prosperity of the lodge 2d now that
ho had been lionored by his brethren in
being elovated to that high position he
would always strive earnestly with the
other Past Grands to be of benefit to the
younger and more inexperienced broth
crs by reason of advice snd solicitude for
their welfare and future Prosperity
