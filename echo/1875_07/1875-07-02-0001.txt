The Auditors and Treasurers Report
were raferred to the Finance committee

TB White chairman of the Rond and
Bridge committee presented his report
recommending that a rate of 14 mills
be imposed on all rateable property in the
County as equalized for 1875 fir Road
and Bridge purposes

On motion of Messrs Dunbar and
White the report was adopted

On motion the report of the equaliza
tion committes was road

Moved by L Wigle seconded by A
MickioThnt the report of the Equali
zation Committee be adopted

Au amondoient of Mr Pattersons to
lay it over till noxt day wus lost on n
vote

A second amendmerit of Mr Patter 
sons to go into committee of the whole
was lost nftor considerable sparring be
tween Messrs Patterson Wigle ler and
Laflerty

Moved by D Dongall seoonded by S
Blanning in amendment that the report
be not adopted but that it be referred to
ask the committee toy amend it by
equalizing Windsor at 798000

D Dongall said the increase put upon
Windsor was more in proportion than
other townships  Morsen Do been de
creased while no one would say but that
property in that township had igorensed
in value Windsor had increased
her nssessmarit beeauso she had to raise
a larger amount of taxes than before
while ghe paid a lnrger proportion of the
taxes than any other municipality while
she derived a loss proportionate benefit
Ho thought the rural Reeves were doing
Windsor an injustice and seemed desir
ous of causing her to separate from the
County If tho Reeves of the townships
forced Windsor into such an equalization
ns that proposed thoy wonld have to
appeal to the judge or dissolve their con

 

 

nection with the County 

J O Ilex considered that no injustice
wos done to Windsor which was dealt
more favorably with than any other
municipality in the County as while an
amonnt of 600000 was struck off ber
roll amounts were added to tho rollsof
other townships They had a right to
equalize before capitalizing

J  Pattorson thought there was no
forco in Mr Ilers remark as if some
townships were assessed low it was the
fault of their assessors  Mersens As
sessmont was reduced 850000 though
prosperous villages were springing up in
different parts of it Tako Leamington
for instance which was doing moro busi
ness than any other place in the County
save Windsor and Amherstburg

L Wigle said that the reason Mersea
was nssessed Jower was that last your she
was assessed for Marah lands on which
no taxes were paid Me Patterson was
not present at the committee mooting or
he might havo looked at the matter in a
different light

Tho amendment was lost 4 yous to 18
nays

An amondment of Mr Pattersons to
reduce Windear to 900000 was lost on a
vote of 6 to 12 a

W McCain said that the committee
had only dono justico to the dignity of
Windsor by 5 hor ssnossment

Another amendment of Mr Pattersons
to reduce Windsor to 060000 was lost

An amendment of Mr Dougall to
raise Merson to 780000 was lost and
