TPYHE high reputation to which thin artiolo ns attained warrants tho bollof that 

posnussed more than ordinary virtuo in the treatment of many chronle complaints Com
bining both nutriment and medicine snd boing singularly avooptablo to the stomach it may
be used with advantage mn many cases whore debility of digestion and system gomerally
forbid the use of the ordinary medicines

By careful analysis it is found to be simple and mildin its character and well adapted
to cases from infanoy to old ago without detriment from continued use

It is now about ten years since I commenced to import and bottle Cod Ydver Oil 1 did
0 only after a very eareful examination of the facts connected with its manufacture as I had
rednon to bolievo that a large proportion of the Cod Liver Oil which is sold was prepared in so
enrcloas o manner as to render it unfit for use Tho wiunl moda of preparing the Oil is so
wanting in ears in the selection of the Hives snd is conducted in ko unoleaniy a mannerin
mamy cases the liver being allowed to nrcomeass in order to facilitata tho oxtraotion of the
Ollas to make the product not only vory disagreeable to the taste and impossible to bo
retained on the usnally delicate stomachs of invalids but nlso to deprive it of other qualities
essentinl to its full efficiency in the class of diseases for which it is usually prescribed

Since the introduction of my Cod Liver OL it has steadily gained vor among physicinna
and others Many have been able to retain it orp the stomach when other Oils ha groed
with them and nauseated so much that they had to abandon their use altogether My Oil ia
pronounced by many to bo the Cleanest Finest Bweotest and most digestible Oil in uso
