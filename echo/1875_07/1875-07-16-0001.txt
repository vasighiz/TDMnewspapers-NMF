The Death of Albert Prince

Albert and Freddy and two young
friends of theirs went into the river op
posito his residence the Firs to bathe
Shortly after getting into
the decensed
some considerable distance into the river
beyond a bed of weeds which skirt the
bank and while attempting to return to
shigre lie became exhausted and was en
tangled in the weeds While attempting
to extricate himself his exortions brought
on an attack of apoplexy the effects of
which caused his death before he wns
taken out of the water
they could to save him partially got him
up on oa raft whioh they took out to him
and held him there till somo men at
work near by came to his assistance
Every possible effort was made to restore
life after he was brought to shore but it
was all unavailingand Dr Nesbitt of Sand 
wich who examined the body says that
death was directly and eolely attributable
to apoplexy

The body was removed to the Park
farm front whenoo the funeral took place
at 880 on Saturday afternoon and was
attended by the bar of the connty in a
body and na large number of friends at
home and from a distance
