D B Odetto gratefully acknowleded
the gift in both French and English He

ments awakened in his mind by such

marks of confidence and remembrance

He was nmong tho first to establish tho
St Jean Baptiste Society amongst them
and in the position of Seerofary

the members whicli lio enjoyed He was
sorry to leave thembut lie could not con
trol circumstances and hie would always
remain a member of their gocicty as well
as of the C M  A Association of which
ho had also been sccrotary He lad
been well repaid by a knowledge that he

love their country as well as their God
and if they only endeavored to follow in
tho footsteps of their patron Saint they
would be doing well 3

 Irenco Gornrd in Fronch expressed
his satisfaction at meeting with them on
the oocasion of such a splendid demon
stration They had turned out in  man
ner creditable to the parish and proved
that they had a truo love for their country
and n great respect for tho memory of
their ancestors Tho hall and school
house which thoy were constreuting and
which would bo greatly aided by that
