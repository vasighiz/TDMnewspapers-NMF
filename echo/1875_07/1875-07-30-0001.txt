THE COUNTY ASSESSMENT

On Thursday the 22nd inst Judge

 Leggatt gave judgment in the enso of the

appeal made by Windsor against tho
equalization of her nssossmont for County
purposes and we must confess wo aro as
tonished at the result of his honors judg
ment Not only haa ho reduced tho ns
sossmoent of Windsor below what it was
in 1874 but ho hua added to the assess
ments of a number of other munioipali
ties which have not increased in value at
all In comparison with Windsor On
what principle of equity or justice for in
stanco hosho added 90000 to the 225
000 neseprmiont of Amherstburg with a
total valnation and a very fair ono at
that of scarcely 300000 while ho has
struck off 110000 of tho 1000000 of
Windsor whose total valuation is oyer
1600000 Wo can sco no  fairness
whatever in oqualizing Amhorstburg at
fivosixdhy of her valuo whilo Windsor is
oqualized at only onehalf of hors ns wo
aro gure tho reproscntatives of Windsor
will bo slow to admit thet Windsor hus
not made at least as great if not greater
proportionate progross ss Amherstburg
during tho past year Again all admitted
that Malden was fairly equalised whilo
Colchester with her hmense trac of
wasto land was placed as high as any ono
could expect still Judge Loggatt has soon
fit in his wisdom to impose additional
burthens wpon both In the eases of
 Gosflold and Mersos also while it was

dod to tho equation

by his honor The imposition of 9330
820 on tho rural municipalities at the
instance of Windsor will do more than
over to widen the gulf between them
The following figures will show the
equalization made by the County Council
