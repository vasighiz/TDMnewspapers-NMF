Mr Collins Croquet Set



Croquet that eminently fascinating
game was introduced on the premises of
the Colling Friday In the afternoon
Podgas boy brought up the set and just
before ten Mrs Ovlling arranged the
wickets Collins had learned to play
when visiting in Glovershire last sum
mar and Mrs Collins acquired an in
different knowledge of the game from two
elderly maiden sisters on Paxton street
And goon that delicious Friday after
noon they teak out the mallets and balls
and commenced the game

Now Emeline playfully observed
Mr Collina dont you begin cheating at
the start 1f you dg the game will be
prostituted to mere gambling an well

build up our physical

People who nre so rendy to charge
aginst others noed close watching them
selves young mann said she in the same
spirit and I mean to keepa sharp eye
on you

Then they both langhed

Pot it will bo a good thing for you
Emelive hie said with  tinze of tend
erncss wm bis voice Youware kept coop
ed up in tho house so that you hardly
get a breath of fresh air This will give 
you exercise and keep you out doors

are too unselfish to think of yohrself

And thus exchanging sentiments which
did credit to both their hearts the game
progressed

After passing throngh the centre wick
et Mr Collins nsed her ball to help him
self through the other wickets to the
upper stake Then he loft her near the
first wicket and struck for the stake
which being about ecight inches distant
made him overconfident The ball miss
ed by ubont pn eighth of an inch

YT declare he exclaimed in vexation

Then she having watched his rapid
progress with n clouded fice now struck
for him ond hit him and a minute later
his ball was spinning throngh the grass
to the other end of tha ground She was
now in a position for her wicket and
Jussad through it nnd then to the stake
ut missed it Then he enme up by a well
directed blow to within two inches of the
stake But she went for him again and
when she got through she was three wick
ota boyond the stake and his ball was
at the other end of the ground again and
his brow wus finely corrugated He
stopped nervously toward it It was
uite evident that he was not unruffied
When his turn eame again he drove back
to the stake but struck a wicket and ro
bounded so close to her that she easily hit
him and again introduced him
throngh wickets he was not for nnd
then sent him flying again Her success

 caused her to laugh and he heard it

You think yon sro pretty smart but
Ill get even with you he said without
smiling

Youll have to play better than you
have done she pertinently Snel

J think I know as much about cro
quet as you do ho said still with a
straight face

You dont play as if you did she re
torted

If youd hind any fairness about you

owd let me had that stroke over when

was up to tho stake You knew I slipp

in the face

No T didnt know anything about it
she replied taking on a little color

A DurLThe Detroit News says 
A duel which was to have taken place in
Windsor Inst woek seems to have been a

utup job for the purpose of relieving
tho Lo of Winder ove day life
The heroes that were to linve boon were
Mr Hiram Bunnell the defaulting shoe
dealer from Detroit and s man named
A N Woelf a resident of St Lonis
The parties had been on a lark the day
provious and Bunnell alleged that he had
4 insulted and the only way in which
his honor could be healed was by a duel
The challenged party was given the
choice of weapons and chose pistols
The preliminaries were all satisfactorily
arranged the duel to take place at 4 a
m Tuesday in o fiold near Windsor At
the appointed time Mr Bunnell was on
the ground looking brave and happy
and Mr Woelf was also on hand after a
good deal of conxing and persunding by
his friends He had an untold amount
of trouble in getting over the low fence
that surrounded the field and his knees
shook like unto one offlicted with palsy
The pistold already loaded with blank
cartridges wero given to the contestants
and about the time that everything was
rendy for the shooting Mr Woelf came
to the conclusion that shooting was bad
business and declared that he would not
stain his hands with the bloodof a fellow
being and no amount of coaxing or
tannting could induce him fo alter his
detormination He therefore inglorious
ly yielded the field to Mr Bunnell who
with his party stalked off the field with
Lajer in the day
hearing that tho police were about to
arrest all parties concerned in the affair
Mr Woelf packed his valise shonldered
his umbrelln and with his bat pulled low
down over his eys hook the duit of
Windsor from jis shoes and is now
sojourning in Amherstburg happy in the
assurance that as 8 ducllist he is not a sue
