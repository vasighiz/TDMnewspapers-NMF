Presentment of Grand Jury

The fallo
the Grand J at the General Sessions
lately held at Sandwich

To his Honor Gordon Watts Leggatt
Judge of the County Court of the
County of Basex 

Wo the Grand Jurors at the pending
General Sessions beg respectfully to pre
sont that we have to tho best of our abil
ity disposed of the comparatively small
amount of business placed in our hands for
consideration

Wo rogrot that the mengroncss of the
docket on this occasion cagnot be taken
ag evidence of the decrease of crime in
your jurisdiction ying to the faet of
the large number of indictments dispos
od of at intorim sessions since the last
meeting of this Court

It is also much to be lnmented that our
proximity to tho large metropolitan city
of Detroit should bo the constantly rocur
ring cause of this enormous incrense of
crime in this locality and we would re
speetfully suggest in this connection the
expediency of the early appointment by
government of a gentleman qualified to
act permanently or upon occasion ns
your deputy or assistant in the perform
ance of the arduous duties devolved upon
the position which you so worthily fill

We have visited the Gaol and have
great pleasure in reporting our hearty
approval of the evidences of cleanliness
and order which are met with throughout
the entire establishment

The County is fortunate in possessing
the services of one so well qualified to
perform the responsible duties of gaoler
as George OC Leech ovidently is

Mr Leech brought to our notice the
dangerous consequences which might at
any time result from allowing the win
dows of the various prison wards to
romain us they are at present unprotect
ed by wirascyeens The addition of these
at an insignificant cost would render it
impossible for confederates of prisoners to
throw into the ward windows from out
side thie walls any instrument or weapon
the use of which in the hands of a culprit
might at any time result in disastrous
consequences 

We have endeavored to got to an intel
ligible understanding of the reasons why
the gaol sewer is the public nuisance it is
at present both as to the gaol premises
and the Town of Sandwich generally

In our opinion the jmperfuct method of 

connection between the to the river
and the reservoirs for the receptacle of
refuse nnd garbage of the establishment
upon the premises of the prison is the
cause of the first  and the fact of the
draing not boing carried sufficiently far
into the river is thi cause of the latter

We would therefore strongly urge that
these defects at once be remedied
