that he should go fo pos Mossrs McLean
and Ferris tosoo how our interests were
getting along there wont tho duy after
the nomination saw Jolin Richimond at
Harrow he come over the rond and spoke
to witnoss and asked if witness had any
money and witness roplied lots of it
Richmond then snid a party wanted 50
and would give a mortgage for it up

 

nothing nnd the counsel for petitioner 
could certainly establish agency if it ox 

ber seeing Richmond talking to Theodoro 

only remember one other transaction of
this kind J

Richmond saidI dont want it for my
myself but for a party whois purchasing n
lot aud making pnyments and is short
fifty dollars Richmond for this man
offered to give Wiglo a mortgage for the
amount Wigle said the sum was oo small
he could let any one have three hundred
dollars on good security Richmond suid
this wns more than was wanted did not
hear Richmond mention MoLenans name
Theodore and myself next went to George
McLeans but found him from homes
went to Robert McLeans and found
George McLean there Theodore Wigle
