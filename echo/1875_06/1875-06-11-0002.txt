But magnificont as these schemes aro
i and engrossing ns thoy inust necessarily
be in their claims upon the attention of
the Minister of Public Works we know
Lim too wall to entertain the thought
that his quick and practical mind would
sock in their magmitnde an excuse for
neglooting smnllor matters We nro per
suaded that lio need only have lis atton
tion dirceted to any matter demanding
amendment or improvement in tho inter
est ofthe country to onlist his earnost and
activo efforts Ihe transit of the river
Detroit is ono of these subjects In this
two powerful railway corporations with
millions of money at stake in our coun
try aro interested and with theirs are
identified more fenlarly the interests
of the people of Southwestern Ontario
whose territory is travelled by the lines
of the Great Western and Canada Southi
ern Railways Our reporter in another
column refors to the difficulties which
there impede the rapid transit of goods
nnd passengers So long a8 the phstaclo
is permitted to continue 50 long will fe
lave a tendency to drive trafic towards
outlets south of the lakeaway from
tho channels which Mr Mackenzie inant
present proparing for it across the terri
tory of tho Dominion The mode of
overcoming the impediments to rapid
transit over the Detroit river most nceep
Lablp to the railway companies wonld un
doubtedly Le abridge or bridges But
the aljections raised by the navigators of
thoriver and the inflagnee they are able
throngh the government of the United
States to control against lie constrnetion
of a bridge are such as to put this meth
od as a remedy for immediate relief out
of the question A tunnel is tho only
adequate remedy at present available
It was hoped at one time that private
enterprise would be quite adequate to
this work As matters now stand it ap
poars to us that it is a work quite nnd
very properly within the purview of tho
Dominion Government and one with
which the Minister of Public Works
should at oneoconcern himself Ifit be
proper forhim to pledge the public credit
for the enlargement of canals the con
strnetion of railways the improvement
of harborsall to stimulate commerce
and to attract through Omnadian chan
 nels as much of the tarrying trade of the
Continent as possible this is just a work
of the proper character It would tend
in an eminent degree to this end Were
3 proposed simply 08 ald to the Canada
Bouthern the proposition would not be
withaut precedent Millions out of the
publie chest have gono by parlimmentary
sanction to aid the Grand Trunk tho
Great Western and the Northern Rail
ways of Canada Tho provincial legis
latures have dealt jn the same liberal
spirit with railways of a more local char
pater Were the Canada Southom Rail
way Company alone concerned in obs
vinting the difficulities of rapid transit
over tho Detroit River the Dominion
Government might with great propriety
recognize its importance by coming to
their assistance In the same manner in
which they came to th aid of similar
onterprises  but the Great Western is
equally with the Canada Southern in
terested i overcoming thd delays acei
dents disappointments and uncertainties
incident to a railway fory over this
river and ns already observed it is not
simply a railway or o corporate interest
that is involved but interests of national
coneirninlerests which it is the duty of
the Government ta look after At De
trait the bottom of the river has boon
fairly tested with a view to the constrne
tion of a tunnel there and fonnd nnsuit
able for it The scliemo had to be ab
andoned ns impracticable F N Finney
formerly Chief Engineer of the Canada
Southern made a careful examination of
ie bottom of the river at Amherstburg
Ho found it hard rock throughout and
capable of being tunnelled with case be
yond almost the perndventure of an
ncoidont and at a comparatively small
outlay To those who know Mr Finney
bis roport is sufficient Hon Mr Mac
kenzie may not have that advantage 
and under such circumstances an oxami
nation of the crossing by one of the
respongiblo engineers of his depa n
might more properly form n basis for
governmental nection in so important a
matler A good railway tunnel bere
would be an invaluable aid in inducing
traffic throngh Canada over the Canada
Southern snd Great Western Railways
A tunnel once constructed here tho
Great Western and Michigan Central
would extend their lines to it and uso it
in common with the Camada Southern
and other lines concentrating at this
point on cither gids Both theso com
ponies wonld be glad to bo Folfewed of
the obligations to lumber all their freight
from the direct snd short route across
the river up through the city of Detroit
and go ferry it across the river We
hope soon to hoar of action being taken
jn this importaut matter under the
surpises of the chief of tho Public Works

with the apparent intention of arousing
