admits the necessity of a enitable public

cannot afford it we would sy that for
the next ten or twenty years they might
say the same thing they have been saying
for m8 many yours past and thus we
could never have a respectable hall
The small additions taxation required

editorial on The Sin of Smuggling 
charges many of our Cunadian Custom
House officers over tlie whole Canadian
peninsula with being either culpably ne
ghigent or corrupt in conniving with
smugglers at defrauding the revenue
This charge is most unjust to the lnrgo
body of faithful and conscientious officials
in this branch of the public service and
the Globe should not Lave been Jed by
ane or twe or even more known instances
of corruption to make such a general
charge Wo fancy that in no branch of
the pullic service have there
been fower known instances of bribery or
connivance and had there been any it is
certainly most probable they would have
