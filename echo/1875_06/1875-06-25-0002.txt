Aunt Sally Sykes

nophow regarded him with scornful com

Pration through ler glassos

I know it I fumed Jeremialr if

thoyd ask me now  Dut its awful to

If you aint a numbskull interrupt
ed Aunt Sally Youll have to dio single

to do his own sparkin aint wuth wastiy

Couldnt you anyhow  repeated her 

nephew

Anyhow  You might ns well ask
your grandmother Td look pretty mar
ryin the fellow Ive held over my knoo
us a boy T hoped to have hickoried some
wonse into yp I and she loft the room ero
lie coulll prevent it leaving him in a state
of perplexed perturbation which ended
in  resolve to sally forth in search of a
wife

Acrogs the street lived three sisters of
loss than thirty years and many longing
glances had been gent through its blinds
toward his dwelling  many times his
figure had set their hearts fluttering only
to sink in vexation ng he failed to come
in and here Jeremiah resolved to make
his first venture

Wo will pass over the proparations in
cident to this errand without comment
The finnneial dnsinges were tho demor
ulization of 0 dozen silk tics and threo
handkerchiefs of which he anointed one
with hair oil and deluged another with
liquid blacking before recovering his son
ses sufficiently to render the third redo
lent of the I love you as an iuterpre
tation of his sentiment  go that it was in
10 envinblo state of mind that he brouglit
up at Inst on tho Misses Simpsons door
tep and knocked for admittance

The door was opened by a slipshod
damsel of fourteen who stood pushing
a disordered crop of hair ont of her eyes

JaisMiss Simpson in  stammer
od Jereminl 

The oliild gavo her head an afiymative
plunge and was immediately extinguish
ch by the shoel of hair

Ono of them is she replied senten
tiously 

Can I soo her dfif sho is not engag
ed

She aint doin nothin  come in

Ho was ushered into a darkened parlor
and shutting the door she left him to
grope his way to a chair

Prescutly footsteps wore heard  bis
heart bognn thumping and to his eternal
disgrace bo it said ie would have embrace
ed the first mode of escapa 3

But there was something better to be
embraced and in a moment Miss Simp
son was before him 

So delighted to see you Mr Sykes
Lsnt it a lovely day 2

Yes stammered Jeremiah go ploas

Yes prompted his hostess ns he ap
peared to be falling into a state of imbeci
lity

I thought Id come otoits such n

 nice doy

Vory  and your farm looks so attrac
tive I often envy you 

Yes Tike it he said dhowing signs
of recovery

You must  and have yon a good
housekaeper 2 Its hard for a single man
to get suited in that yespect B

Yeos murmured Jeremiah mine

 docs very well  but I feel the need of a

a

A wife said Miss Simpson you
should lLiave one

perhaps 1

Miss Simpson became delightfully con
fused

Ploase to speak a little plainer Mr
Sykes

 

I want a wife Miss Simpson Will

A mingled sob and chuckle esenped
Miss Simpsons lips and this being the

crisis slo Jot her head sink upon his 

shoulder  
Oh Jereminh nro you sincere 

Of comrse I am Aint you said
Jereminh taking the cue

Sincere now and lways and LI
prove it by fixing an early doy and the
customary lovers seal served nso pune
tusition point

Now its all done  exclaimed the re
lieved lover only dont tell anybody yet
awhile

Your wigh ghall be my law Jeremi
ali was the obedient response  and an
honr after he took his departure leaving
his fiancee in a delightfully satisfied state
of mind

1 didnt know sparking was so ensy
he soliloquized over bis evening pipo 
but there Ive no iden which one of the
three I proposed to I must remember
and ask tomorrow Shell know any
bow 

On tho morrow however Jerusha the
fortunate one found to her vexation that
she hind a business errand that musts be

attended to Her sisters wore likewise
gone out and before starting sho called
the domestic

 Belay if Mr Sykes calls today tell
him Im ont 

 Yesm suid Betsy looking as stupid
a8 possible

Dont forjet nnd Jerusha departed 
while two hours later Joreminh stood at
his ingmoratas door but in some uncer
tainty ns to whether the previous days
experience was real or only a hallucina
tion

 Im sure I come here ho mused j
and that shoshesaid  yes  Any
Biow Ill ask her again to make sure 1
aint o bit afraid now

Meanwhile the second sister havin
come homo earlier than usnal wns sonte

not feeling onlled upon to volunteer any

y grew alarmed nt her lovers absence
and doubts of his constancey and visions
of breach of promise suite haunted hor
disturbed faneies while Melinda bore for
a while her lovers absence with great
equanimity but as it grew prolonged she
became nervous in lier turn Finally the
two sisters had another enll frora home
leaving Alviun in charge of the house
and each one sought her with the identi
cal requost 

If Mr Sykes or anyonethe any
ane to lull suspicion calls for me tell
them Ill be home by evening

Alvina assented but whon alone gave
her lead a coritemptuons toss

 Mr Sykes vimt wont bo for yon I
