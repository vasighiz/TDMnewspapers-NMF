I offer the above described Farm for Sale tis most beautifully located being but hall
nmilo from the now flourishing Town of Amherstburg which is fast coming into the most
favourable notice both throughont Canada and the United States being the terminus of
the Canada Southern Rail Road The farm contains one hundred acres more or leas It is
most advantageously located for eubdivision into lots of five tan twentyfive or fifty acres
It has on it ranning through the centre a beantiful grove com rising in part hickory
walnut onk and elm of about 25 acres most of the farm being cleared makes it a source
of revenue and enjoyment from the time Joizoadon in taken thereby obviating the dire
neoossity of wearing out both body and mind clearing land that somebody olse may reap the
benefits of and enjoy There are excellent fences on the farm About 60 acres is virgin
soil suitable for gardening farming or pasturing It is sufficiently rolling to afford all
drninago necessary thereby saving several thousand dollars in tile draining There in an
excellnot market in the vicinity and all kinds of farm products may be sold without going
of the farm thereby saving a great deal of timo to men and wear and tear to teams
Ithas oll the advantages of the churches schools and stores of the town with merely
nominal taxation in fact it is such a farm as a good steady honest industrious man could

do well with but a shiftless lazy drinking goodfornothing man has no business with
such o place and need not apply

VARIETY EXTENT AND CHEAPNESS

My stock is cortainly not surpassed in Amherstburg
