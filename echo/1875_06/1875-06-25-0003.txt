Presbyterian Union in Canada

On Tuesday Jnne 156th an event for
which many earnest mon have long
labored was consummated in the union in

 ona eeclesinstical organization of all the

Presbyterian chmrches of Canada The
four organizations whish formally anited
wera all in gossion in Montreal and on
tho day mentionad the Moderator ofeach
for the church he represented signed the
basis of union previously greed upon
The bodies uniting wero the Presbyterian

Church of Canndain connection with thie 

Church of Scotland the Cunadn Prosby
terian Church the Synod of the Lower
Provinces of British North America sud
the Synod of the Maritimo Provinces in
connection with tho Church of Scotland
There was soma slight opposition in ench
organization to tho proposed union but
the sentiment in each was overwhelming
in favor of it The name of the united
church is to be the Drashytesiin Church
of Canndn Tt is the only Presbytorinn
body in the Dominion witli the exception
of the small Reformed Chnreh of the
Lower Provinces and tho fow dissenters
from the union It will however in all
probability gradually attract and absorb
the separate churches until not a trace
of opposition to it among Presbyterinns
will be apparent The Presbyterian
Church of Connda will be the largest
Protestant body in the Dominion By
the census of 1871 tho mnnmber of
adbierents of the churches which now
constitute it was 526000 to 494000
Episcopalians and 410000 Methodists of
5 classes It hos nearly 100000
communicants over 600 ministers and
1000 congregations has six colleges in
connection with it and is divided into
fortysix Pregbyteries

A Horrible Case



Dati bY THE Ansonprion of Porson
oN A DEAD BobyA VALUABLE LIFE
SAorFIoRD

 

The following commuuieation to the
Erie Pennsylvania Argus will be
rond with interest by many people in
this county to whom Dr Durteh was
well Jmown He wns murdied to a
daughter of the late Abner Tidwell of
Colchester

To the Editor of the Bria Argus 

Our whole community bas been shock
od by the sad and bovis death of one
of our most prominent and highly esteom
ed oltizens in the person of Dr 5 A
Burtely which ocourred yesterdny The
oironnitances nttonding tho case are
substantially as fullows

Dr Burtch had hod under his profoss
ional care for some three or four yours an
cldorly patient named Davis who had
required trontmentmoro or less froquont
ly during the whole time But there
seomod to be something peculinr nbout
the case of Mr Davis which neither Dr
Burteh mor other physicians whe had
heen consulted a satisfactorily fath
om The patient Mr Davis died two
weeks ago lust Suturday and with thie
permission of the friends to satisfy lim
self concerning the cnse as well as to
obtain useful knowledge for the profess
ion Dr Burteh proceeded to make n
post mortem oxamination which roveal
a poculinr intestinal tumor At the time
of making the exmminntion however
the Dr tock no precaution to pnard
agninst accident or injury to himself al
though he hind o slight ent or scratch
upon the index finger of the left hand
and what is still more strange ho did
nothing to clennso the wound or kill the
poison so certain to be absorbed in the
operation until the next doy when the
finger become somewhat inflamed and
painful he eawderized the wound with
nitrate of silver and gave the matter no
further attention Though conscious of
not feeling as well ns usunl he contin
ued to attend to lis professional enlls
and other business until the following
Saturday just one woek from the time
of th post mortem examination when
lio gave up and summoned his brother
physician practicing in eastern Ohio
and his brotherinlaw Dr Robertson
of Cambridge Critwford County Loth of
whom at ones pronounced it a cnso of
 septic poisoning A thorongh dourse
of treatment wns immediately adopted
and tho most powerful remedies known
to have efficacy in cases of poison were
mado uso of but without avail The futal
virus had held sway in the systom too
long to bo eradicated and the patient was
already beyond the rach of human aid
or professional skill The development
of the disease wnsmo doubt retarded hy
tho cfforts of the attending physicians
but it progressed slowly and surely to the
end tho unfortunate man retaining his
consciousness till an hour or two bofore
his death which took place at seven
oclock last evening Dr Burtch was
an energetic worker very much dovofed
to lis profession in which he had boen
very successful and had secured a fine
practice He was highly respeoted
throughont the community and his logs
is one which will not spon be replaced

The sympathies of all are extended to his
grief stricken wife and friends
