Marit 1875

Mn EnrrosDear SirYon are aware
that I am necessarily abaent from old Am
herstburg my yespected home the most
part of the year and I have to thank you
und your excellent paper for keoping mo
posted in matters aboat tho old town It
pleases me almost as much to get the Eemno
 55 34 does to get a letter from my wife but
 the comparison is lost to you as you have
 never axperiereed such pleasure There is
one matter that you fully report that I take
an uncommon interest im and that ia the
Comeil proceedings and I sce by your paper
of the 14th inst that there are two men bo

 

before the flood but if the earth was to bo
oncumbered with their presence in this year
of Grooe 1875 their lot ought to have heen
cast with a community more in unison with
their ideas such as the wandering Arabs or
or glpsoy tribes Nothing in the shape of
progress ever enters their brains living on
as thoy have lived from time immemogial
Six months hoist is it 7 1 would rather sce
each of thom get nn six yoors hoist to more

snitablo placgs for such minds than a

you may draw some good mens attention to

Murder near Wallaceburg

Mrs Finlay has made the following
confession of the murder of her husband
near Wallaceburg by herself and para
mour 

On Friday morning Smith told mo he
had arranged the murder for the night
before but there being no cap on the
fun he did not carry it into effect
Friday he went into the stabs to sui po
tatoes for seed and capped tho gun At
one oclock on Sutunay worning he
went into the stable and loosed the Lorse
to make a noise to draw Finlsy out
Finlay boing awake got up and went
out I heard the report of the gun
A minute or 80 after Faith cams to the
door and knocked I went to tho door
Smith told me it was done A short time
after this I went to the bed whore Smith
and no boy called Shanks were sleeping
and protended to awake them They
got up and went to the stable I then
went out and asked what was the matter
ono of them replied Ho is dead Smith
and Shavks then went and called tho
neighbors

 

 Very soon after thid confession the
Jury returned a verdict of silful mr
der by Willian Henry Smith and Mra
R 8 Finlay ns an necomplico to it and
committed them for trial at the coming
assizes at Samia
re eee
