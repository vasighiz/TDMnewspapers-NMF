turned to the village and his grave eyes
fixed vacantly upon the blue a gas

ittle Ginnetta I Hor head sank back
among the pillows and almost without n

Nicolo remained gazing absently upon
hor lovely face Alns for the first time

Wild with griof he wandered about all

ing companionship He appeared to be
about thirtoon yenrs of age his face was
pole and sorrowful his eyebrows strong
ly marked while his dark eyes sparkled
with a weird brillianey which at times
lind an almost sinister oxpression

 He remained lost in thought for some
time bis head resting upon his slim ner
vous hand listening to the murmuring
waves ai they broke nt his feet gaming
sndly across to the distant horizon with
unutterablo longing Suddenly the joy
ons Inughter of childhood broke upon his
musings  a little girl came running
nevoss the field and throw both arms
about his nock 

Ql you naughty naughty Nieolo
what are you doing hero Tve been
looking everywhere for you Utlering
these hnlfscolling words she continued
to overwhelm him with enrerses and lnid
a littlo basket filled with roses and oglan
tines at Lis foct in token of her childish
affection The shadow of a smile flitted
neross the boys face as he looked into
Ler longhing eyes 3 he yan his fingers
through her glossy eurls gave a cautions
look around and said 

T ran away from my father Ginnetta
lie pave me leave to vest eal cams to
his lovely placeyou know how I value
wy short liberty and iow I adore the
murmuring of these waves Listen to
their weird musio I

Tt is 400 bad of your father sighed
tho olild to torment you with thoso
hateful exercises you will die of over
work Poor Nicolo so mother snid to
me 415 much too delionto  his bowitched
violin will bo the death of him before
Jong and it will be his fathers fault 
And mother is right she ndded looking
snxiously ot his worn face

Po not fear for me Gianetin suid
Niculo I shall not die yet 1 must
grow up to be a man Look how strong
I um He drew himself upto his full
height Lis dark eyes flashed and a smile
of rarn tenderness played around his lips
with bis strong arms he lifted his little
playmate and licld her suspended over the
wuter for some seconds Sadness does
not linger long in the heart of a child
Ginnetta secing him so gny commenced
singing pnusifig ever and anon for some
bit of childish gossip Nicolo listened am
used at the arlless prattle about her
flowers her doves her games and dolls
and whenever he sank into a fit of ab
siraction Ginnetta quickly brought him
to himself with a playful shake or tender
kins

The children remained on the strand
until tho stars camo out one after anoth
or smiling nlike on the serious cyes of
Nicolo and the drowsy ones of the pretty
Ginnetta Then indeed they turned
their steps homeward their arms wound
around each other in the innocent loving
embrace of childhood After n long walk
they turned down  narrow laue at the
oud of which stood two humble cottages
ono the home of Ginnetta and the other
of NidoloAt the threshold of the for
mer stood the mather of the little girl
anxiously awaiting the retwrn of the
children whom she tenderly embraced
na thoy camo running up to her then
wishing cach other poodnight Nicolo
crossed over to his home

On entering his dingy little room he
sighed deeply raised the window to letin
he mild might air and opening a chest
drow from it an old violin Seating him
sell near thn ment through which the
silyery moon t floated he passed his
finfrors neross the strings and drew from
them ho most entrancing strains of mus
ig dying away ot times into wondrous
melancholy tion swelling into triumph
ants gladness

Searcely had he commenced playing
when a large spider crawled ont of the
vines and camo onthe shutter

 Welcome  cried the young musician
gayly  and as it advanced he laid hig
nger on the window sill allowed the
spider to make its way over it and plac
ed it in triumphuponhis vialin where
it remnined during the whale perfor
mance 08 if entranced by the wonderful
magic of the music

Nicolo remained practicing until his
eyelids cloeed in slecp and not until the
sun alone in his eyes did ho wake from
his soundisjumbers Ho arose and re
placed his mute companidn carefully up
on the vine loaves

Every time that he laid aside his vio
lin he sauk inte hisdwabitual morbid re
very Tho absence of the spider increas
ed this focling of solitude for he was
nttaclied to the crosture with all the
passion of a fervent nnd unhappy dispo
sition His father wis a hard and re
lontless manhis dend mother he ouly
remembered dimly as laving sweetly
smiled upon him ns she sung him to
sleep with lier gentle lullaby But that
was so long long ago and now he had
uo frionds Only little Gianotta was
good to him coming often to his room
and listening in eilont admiration to the
inspiring music of his violin  But Gin
notte detected his spider There is
witcheraft in it she would say with a
dainty little shadder and o the insect
wis never admitted during her visits 
When hia fingers grow stift with exer
cise Nicolo enlivened the bours by tell
ing fairy tales romantio adventores and
his own hopes for the uture to his little
comphnion who would listen without
dpring to interrupt her eyes gleaming
with joy as eho pressed the feverish hands
of her agitated narrator Sometimes
Nieolo told her of Mozart who was al
ready fumous at tho tender nge of six

0 Ginnetta I he would exclaim
how small I seem beside him and
hot tears chased down his attenuated
chooks

Ono day the young musician under the
direction of his father had been perform
ing o series of monotonous exercises so
that lis arma seemed paralyzed Utter
ly worn out he laid aside violin and
looued his weary head against the win
dow when snddenly he heard a sharp
5 Tt was tho mother of Gianetta who
called to him Springing up with alac
rity he ran ncross to his playmates
shome Ho found the little girl lying on
her bed her form worn with fever her
breath coming hard and slow and her
bright ayes looking fixedly into spacs
On recognizing her friend she looked at

 him with asupplicating glance which
Nicola wterproted With tears
in his eyes bo ran swiftly for his dis
carded instrument crying os he camo

 Burping of a Catholic Church

SevestyRive Lives Lost

SenivarigLp Mass Moy 27One of
the most terrible disasters in the history
of Massacliusotts ocomred tonight in the
burning of the French catholic church at
Holyoke during the evening service in
volving the death of about 75 men wo
men and children The exercises had
nearly closed and a vespey seyvice was
bejng sung when the flames from a candle
caught thegdrapery around the statue of
the Virgin Mary which streamed up aud
ignited the building immediately A
panic ensued and the people rushed for

 the doors There was but one entrance
to the gallery and that from the front
On the stairway leading from tho gallery
the people were packed in a solid mass
struggling to clear thomselye ns the
flames roghed in that direction and this
soon became blockaded rendering exit
impossible Many jumped over the sides
of the galleries on the crowd beneath
and were trampled on and killed The
priests residence joins the church on the
north and many escaped through an
antrance leading to the house back of the
altar Tho priests excrtions to keep
order were fruitless The screams of the
living and moans of the dying made o
deafening tumult above the orders of the
pastor who working moet heroically
wns personally instrumental in saving
many lives The audience numbered
about 700 persons Those in the body
of the church escaped but owing to the
joan at the gnllery stairs the loss of life
among the gallery occupants was fearful
The gallery skirted both sides of the
building with ouly one entrance from
tho front The scene was terriblo while
it lasted for the whola was over in
twenty minotes Besides 606 dead there
arc etough fatally wounded to earry the
total loss of life np to 75 On the olt
sid people cleared the way several times
but as often it was blocked up sgain
The windows were broken open and
several escaped in that way

Public Opinion

 

 

Public opinion is an arguseyed hydra
headed monster ever on the alert upon
ovary side for sustenance to gratify its
insatinte and naverdying craving for
prey over which it glonts with all the
sickening infatuation that is displayed by
the hideous cobra preparing to devour its
victim dashing upon the unwary unsus
specting wreteli its handmaid Rumor seizes
upon its subject and with the foul broth
or her twin sister Scandal soatters its ful
somonoess to the winds aud then revels in
tho ngony of the sufforer

Fumo has its aspirants wealth has its
devotees but Public Opinion commands
the unconditional reverenco of sll
What is fear but another name for hom
age paid to Publie Opinion

What mnke us walk in the straight
aud narrow path of honesty and moral
rectitude iil outward semblances
of love for our fellow creatures 

What is it that causes usto give with
our hands when our sordid hearts forbid
tho charity and withold the hearts
outponrings for fear the action would
bo misconstrued What is it for
which many a ons would brave the tor
ture of the damned 2

What is it that causes mankind to con
coal in their breasts n seothing surging
hell of passions nnd emotions the mawl
strom of which is secreted by smiling
faces nnd oxternsl evidences of gaiety
and happiness 

What is it that has desolated many a
hearth and driven many o loved but err
ing ono  more sinngd against than sin

ing to an early and untimely grave 

at but the dread of Public Opinion

Yet how fitild for one nggrioved deem 
ing himself sufficiontly strong in the
righteousness of his cause girded with
tho armor of Truth and an approving
conscience to challenge Public Opinion
to cuter the arena of fuet and do battle
for justice True there aro and have
been those who have succeeded in re
deeming themselves from tho slurs of
fulso report and evil rumor yet these ox
ceptions but serve to prove tho rule

la such an extent do we acknowledge
this power that wo meekly and hambly
bow to its mandate without socking to
rectify ourselves in the oyes of the world
content to bear the ignominy of repronch
through n knowledge of onr powerless
ness to combat the fiat of Public Opin
ion
 To apporently submit to the verdiot of
Public Opinion is the best and most often
only proceedure to issue triurnphant for

carried up into tho tower and thrown up

the church is suspected as being the per
petrator of this frightful crite and the

short of an insptinte thirst for blood or a

could prompt a human being to commit
such an unnatural crime
