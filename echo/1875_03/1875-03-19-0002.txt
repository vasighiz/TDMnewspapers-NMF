themselves These looked so small that
thoy thought the job would be mero play
A strapping big buck at lastostopped up
to one of the smaller boxes and laid hold
of it as though with the intention of toss

The box nomore moved than if it had
been frozen to the sidewalk The self

before radiated the red mans countenance
gave place to a look of profound astonish
mod Whoooop said he as he
backed away from the box to the distance
of some paces Woo0o000 one damn

away in his own native lingo and lnlf a
dozen other Indinus came forward and
one alter nnathier took liold of and lifted
the end of the box They then tried all
