Mn CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN T nm
lad Nis quassion of a Town Hall was
vorgh np for it hos stirred ws up wonders

fully and offered an excellout opportunity
for us to discuss our wants and requires
wents I have endeavored to show yan
according to my way of thinking that wo
did mot require a new hall 1 shall
 now endeavor to show you what we do
 want what we require and what we
must have if we would prosper wud
keep paco with other parts of our pro
wince Tam pleased to ree so great evi
dence that our people are at last alive to
tho fact that wo must neh even if it does
cost us something at tho start This is
anit should be for o goon ns the inhabi
tants of a town or village become convine
od thoy must exert themselves for their
own benefit and advancement just so
sure is iv that that place will prosper
and advance usit is that Amherstburg
for 80 years did not prosper or advance
for want of this energy Last years
action in voting a bonus secured tous
the works of Messrs McFate  Co  Dur
ing my canvass around town I have had
many questions asked mo diel heard
many statements concerning this factory
It seems to bo accepted by all as vary
properly it should be as a practical illus
tration and evidence of the results seenred
to a town by granting bonuses This

 Deing the case gentlemen I ask you for

 apatient hearing while I roview this the

result of eur first move in the way of pro
 gress iu giving our first bonus I shall
state nothing but what can be substandin
ted by the best authority Mr RB MclFate

formation I give you nnd besides I Have
satisfied myself of the fakts by be
 fuspection of their books and they wi
tertify to all T mew state to you In ad
voeating the raising of a sum of money

by some in this manner It muy be nll
very well to advocate the raising of this
money but when we have ra it what
guarantee have we thal afjer We grant a
company a bonus of 2100EL ay
