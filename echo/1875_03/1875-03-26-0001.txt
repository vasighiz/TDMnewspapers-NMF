Dear SinBelieving you and many
of your rondera take an interest in the
Temporance Work I have thought 1
would write you a fow lines on the pro
 gress of the cause in this place It may
be interesting to know that we are alive
 to the allimportant issuo of tho day
Prohibition 

Last Thursday evening n most cloquont
lecture was delivered in the Town Hall
hero by the Rov Mr Chisholm the
agent of tho Grand Lodge of I 0 G T
Brother Bush ocenpied the chair and
after prayer the lecturer was introduced
Heo amponneed his intention of leoturing
on Prohibition and proceeded to prove
that the traffic in intoxicating liquors was
not only a moral curse but a financial
loss and proved tho truth of his assor
tions by plain foots aud figures He
briefly reviewed the licensing system
which was a failure and said the Goy
ernment for the sako of gain might as
well try to rogulate the spread of amall
pox or measles without striving to antirely
stamp them out Ho belioved nothing
short of total prohibition would stamp
out this great evil which is ruining many
households and spreading broadcast

misery and erimo Ho concluded amid
hearty applause

Tho chairman oped the looture would
nerve them to renewed efforts to reclaim
tho fallon drunkard and to save others

from falling Ho reminded the audience

that from their goographienl position in
tho centro of the county and of business

enterprise great things were expected
from them in the temperance work

A collection was taken up and the
mocting dispersed after singing doxology
