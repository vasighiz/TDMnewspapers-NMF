v Samuel MeGoo was called on and said

there was no donbt that we wanted a
Town Hall as oir prosent one was uns
safe He had beorin it when de was
wleatd of his life Suek a hall as we had
wasn disgrace to the town and we
might obtain n good one for 7000 or

48000 Our finsnees were in a goad
condition Ko was in favor of building

a Town Hall in the cordre of the town
and not neay the Township of Mallen
nor in the park which we were likely to
obtain  Pie hall wonlld be accessible to
alli partios if built on the present site 

RE G Pork thought My MeGoe satis
mate fell short of the probable cost of a
halle He was in favor of building a good
ono when wo went iuto it and when we
could afford 146000 for it and thon it
would bea credit to the town
only 8000 were invested we would
receive a revenue of 8600 n yoeor for it
The hall would probably viold 250 rev
enue but while receiving this nmount ao
number of troupes would take away byor

money to better advantage
