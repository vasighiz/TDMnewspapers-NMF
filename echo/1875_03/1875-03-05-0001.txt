THE ASYLUM GRC
We lope it is still possible 0 make

some change in the propos d manner
of disposing of the Asylum Gremnds as
far as the time for the payment of the
purchase money is concerned We find
much dissatisfaction oxpresssd with the
proposal to allow only five anmual pay
ments instead of ten ns was expected
and the feeling is almost universal that
the tendency of fixing sueh a short time
will be to throw the majority of the lots
into the hands of monied speculators
instead of giving our citizens gn oppor
tunity of obtaining lots for the erection
of private residences It was leo expect
ed that eight or ten acres would have
been allowed for a Public Park as prom
ised by Colonel Coffin and we hope our
Council will not fail to call the attention
of the Department to this promise as
well as communiento with Mr McGregor
who will do all in his power tp benefit
our town

LAST FRIDAYS MEETING

The large attendance and great inter
est manifested at the meeting of rate
payers last Friday evening plainly proves
that there is hope for Amherstburg
yet and that the best hopes for her
advancement as a town will not be long
in realization The feeling in favor of a
new Town Hall to cost 8000 or 10000
was almost unanimous and there is little
doubt but that when the bylaw is sub
mitted for carrying into effect the wishes
of Fridays moeting the vote will be
largely favorable to the eroction of a
building that will be a credit to the town
and relieve us of the standing disgrace of
o publio building like we now have The
only objection likely to bo taken is what
local feeling may arouse as a number of
parties aro desirous of removing it from
its present central location Grounds
will also likely be obtsined for a market

We must confess that the result of the
the meeting on the bonus question fairly
surprised even ourselves sanguine as we
were that the people were favorable to
granting additional bonuses The pass
ago of a resolution to raise 15000 as p
bonus fund was no doubt the result of the
conviction which has at length forced
itself on the minds of the people that the
Novelty Works have been of immense
benefit to our townandn desiremow man
ifests itself to enconrnge many other such
mannfacturers to locate here Although
some objection may betaken to the man
ner of raising and holding in reserve the
fund as proposed in the resolution as
placing too much in the power of the
advantagesin that
they will be able to deal decisively with
all applications coming before them and
without the delay consequent on the
passage of a bylaw in each case The
difficulty might be obviated by submit
ting the bylaw in such a shape that
after the fund is formed it will be noces
sary to submit each ense immediately to
direct voto of the people before the
amount is paid to the applicant who lias

 complied with the necessary conditions

The good results of last Fridays meeting
aro already manifesting themselves ns we
hear of severnl manufacturers who are
now desirous of locating here among
them o carringe factory a furniture fact
ory nnd a pork packing establishment
The Council will at once take steps to

have the necessary bylaws submitted to
the people

THE C S R AND WINDSOR

The Board of Trade of Windsor is mak
ing an extraordinary effort to have a
branch lino of the Canada Sonthern
Railway built from Essex Centre to
Windsor in anticipation that al through
passenger aud freight traffie would then
pass through Windsor instead of by
Amherstburg Mr Dougall the presi
dent has written a letter to Mr Rucker
in which ho says 

Having resided personally for ten years at
Rosabank near your Anderdon terminus I have
all slong been certain that you could not make
a satisfuctory crossing there while the delay in
connection with it will always prevent through
passengers oven in summer time from Detroit

that route

Mr Rucker replies and says 

 The country n and about Essex Centre is
one of the best we have and Js surrounded by
BOING VOry onto and flourishing town
ot which Tih io Musto Motions on our spain

no would give to your eity a large trade 0
distance is about 15 miles to build and I suppose
tho right of way would be almost entirely danat
od and bonuses and ment sid could be
had to more than do the gradin Sing and
Jenotug If this can be and believe it can
be y Sur ouliipan would no doubt take tho
 proparty iron  ad fu tio
actor Shimer 3 Posy

On motion the matter af the Southern Rall
way extammion into the town of Windsor was re

charter tho feasibilit a bonus from the
fotnisiyalities thro oh the road woul
run and the cost of of the road
Yer ilo end the cost of tha sigin of

Bauthiern au hari Jor She priposs of

at Windsor and which ean bo more
than made up in the running time be
tween here and Buffalo The idea of 
branch line to Windsor ever boing more

 

 

 

 

than a local line is absurd ns it is
not very likely that except in onse of a
stoppage of the ferry the company will
run their Chicago passengers and freight
between 80 nnd 40 miles around by
Windsor up one bank of the river and
down the other merely to accommodate
those liberal  Windsorites who gave
such enconragement to the Road when
building when they have only to run
three or four miles from hero to Trenton
on the direct Chicago Air lino It is
also very likely that the Southern will
toar up their seventy miles of road from
Trenton to Fayette and lay it down
in another direction just to please
those same dear Windsorites Mr
Rucker evidently appreciates their kind
ly feeling towards the Southern Road
when ho in fact tells them if they wont
o branch they must build it themselves
und it is very likely that ratepayers who
grumble at  bonus of 6000 to a line of 
steamers will cheerfully acquiesce in 
raising 80000 or 100000 to build al
little 16 mile railway to present to the 
Connda Southern Tho terms proposed 
by Mr Rucker evidently dont satisfy 
them if the Committe appointed is any 
indication of their feeling Then as to a
grant from the Government what right 
have the Windsorites to expect that they

would obtain anytltug from the Govern 
mint for this purpose what claim either 
by right or justice could they assert even

if Mr Mowat with a new Parliament 
not yet called together would for a

moment consent to entertain it 

Amherstburg could with mucli more

Justice psk the Government for a grant

to build a railway from here to Loaming
ton We fear the Windsorites will have
to give up their pot scheme as all the
Southern requires to accommodate their
traffic till the tunnel is built ida winter
bridge from Amherstburg to Bois Blane 
and with their ferry in summer they will
be able to get on with little extra ox 
pense and still carry out their idea of an
airline to Chicago to which place they
will require to extend their line with as
little delay as possible And when the
tannel is built we will thank the Wind
sorites to turn over tho through trade of
the Great Western to us and we will no
doubt be able to find room in Amherst
burg for a few at least of those now
most anxions to reside on the through
line of the Canada Southern and thus
realize for them their brightest expecta 
tions 5
