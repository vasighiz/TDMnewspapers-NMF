Farse AraryOn Monday evening
about 8 o clock an alarm of fire was
raised but on proceeding to the locality
it was fonad that it was only a chimney
on fire on Mr Campaus house in rear of
Kolfages hardware store A fire in that
neighborhood would be very destructive
and with the poor appliances we bave for
extinguishing firespeople ought to be ex

 ceedingly careful

 

RAmwAY AccmeNT  On Tuesday
evening last as the 845 express train
on the Southern from here to
Detroit was passing Grosse Isle
owing to a misplaced switch the en
gine tender and baggage car were thrown

which he was riding in front of MoFatos
works on Dalhousie Street at noon on
Tuesday He was picked up by two men
passing and taken home it was found
that the horse had stepped on his head
cutting the soalp for about three inches
His legs wore bruised but his injur
ies are not serious and he will soon be all

right

Shpunel  number of times at consider

depended upon to weigh correctly at an
