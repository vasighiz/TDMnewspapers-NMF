THE SLIDING SCALE

The Montroul Herald one of tho prin
cipal Ministerial organs is formed this
weekuand has in fact reasons to believe
that the sliding scale clause in the
Treaty about which so much has been
snid and written lins beon eliminated by
the Government so that goods montion
ed in the schedules will be placed in the
free list of the Reciprocity Treaty on
both sidos of the line

This will do away with on veryseripus
objection many partios bothLiberal dnd
Conservative linve had to tle Roaiproc

much time is necessarily consumed so
that in the new table the time allotted to
this train between Buffalo and this town
is nearly 16 hours This brings the train
with the mail and the Toronte dailies in
to Amhorstbury at such a late hour that
they eannot be obtained till next morn
ing when the papers are over 80 hours
old and wlen jt is too late to answer let
ters by the mail east on the Southern till
the day following We hope to see some
arrangement made by which this objec
tion will be over come and Amherst
burg will not bo 12 hours behind the rest
of the Province in obtaining the news of
the world

On Monday the Hon Mr Mowat in
troduced the longexpected bill for tha
redistribution of seats in this province
aud it was with much surprise that on
reading over the speech of the hon gen
tleman we saw that no provision had been
made for increased representation for
Essex nor was even any reference made
to this county as to why our claims were
not considered The six additional meni
bers are to be given fo Parry Sound and
Muskoka Dufferin new county Huron
Grey Kent and Lambton The con
stituency of Bothwell is to be abolished
and the oxtra sent given to Simcoe This
will make the house consist of 88 mem
bors Huron Grey and Simcoe having
three instead oftwo and Kent and Lamb
ton two ihstendgof one eal Cardwell
the Wellingtons North Victoria the
Peterboros Brockville nnd South Leeds
are resrrangod while to Ningarn are
added Stamford Clifton and Chippawa
Thus nearly all the existing inequalities
in the representation by population have
received some attention but Essex is not
considered The county of Dufferin for
instance receives a member although its
population is only 15508 and the cxcuse
for this is that there are twentytwo con
stituencies which have populations less
than it will have ranging from 7000 to
15000 and yet Bssex has a population of
82697 and no excuse is offered for not
giving hier an extra member Again the
principle is laid down that to secure two
or three members a county should have
18418 inhabitants for each member and
this i8 carried out in the cases of Huron
Kent Lambton and Grey but when it

comes to apply the principle to Simcoe it
is qoother matter Because a portion of
South Simcoe has been taken to form
another county and another representa
tive  thus granted to that district it is
argued that South Simcoe with a popula
tion of 15487 should have a member
well because it is larger than very many
constituencies already ond upon the
whole they thought Simcoe ought to have
three membersand  to obtain three
members it was found necessary to divide
North Simeoe with 83719only 1000
more than Essesinto two constitu
