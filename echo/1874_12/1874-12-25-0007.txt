It is now abontten years since I commenced to import and bottly Cod Liver Oil
L did so only after a very carefy examination of the facts connected with its manufac
ture ag I had reason to believe that a large proportion of the Cod Liver Ol which is soli
was prepared in so careless n manner as to render jt unfit for nse The usual mode of
preparing the OI Is so wanting fu cate fn the selection of the livers and is conducted in
so uncleanly a mannerin many cases the livers lieing allowed to decompose in order
to facilitate the exisaction of thn Oias to make the product not only very disagreeable

to the taste and jmpossible to be retained on the usually delicate stomachs of invalids
but also 40 deprive it of other qualities essential to its full efficlency in the class of dis
enses for which it Is usually prescribed

Sines the introduction of my Cod Liver Ol it hus steadily gained vor among
physicians and others Mang have been uble 0 votain it on the stomhch when other
Oils had disagreed with them and nauseated so much that they had to abandon thair use
altogether My GU is pronounced by many to be the Cleanest Finest Sweetest anit
most Digestable Oil in use
