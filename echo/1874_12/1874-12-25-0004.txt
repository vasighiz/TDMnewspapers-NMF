of the order of Good Templars and now
England had 250000 membes next in
order wns Scotlund then Wales and the
fourth was Ontario with 85000 Oue
your ago there were only 900 in Essex
now there were 1876 There were now
989000 members of their order in the
world The temperance work had done
much good in Amherstburg and now no
drunkurds wero seen in thpt town reeling
on the streets on a Sabbath We saw
many of the ovil effects of intemperance
in the country but its eflects were much
worse in large cities He complimented
the pooplo of Colchester on their boautiful
hall which did them gront eredit nud it
was fir ahead of the one in Amlherst
barr Io supposed they were preparing
to be the hub of the South Riding

ors of whicly wero men of temperance
principles and who would devote consid
erable space to their iuterests He ad
vised temperance in enrly lifeus then they
would not have the habit to conquer in
