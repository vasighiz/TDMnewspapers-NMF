TUE DISSOLUTION

Wo announced in our last weeks issuo
that the elections for the Loeal Lagislaturo
would all be over before the 20th of Jun
nary and this turns out to be the cuse
as we find tho Globe on Tuesday last
announcing that the Writs for a new
clection to the Provincial Legislature
will be issued immedintely and that the
nominations throughout the Province
have been finally fixed for Monday 11th
January and the polling for Monday
18th of Janupry Thors ia therefore not
much time left for canvassing and cau
cussing and the contest will be short
sharp and decisive We anticipate the
reception of the Writs and the issuance
of the proclamations about the end of tho
present or the beginning of noxt week

MUNICIPAL NOMINATIONS

At noon on Monday next tho electors
of this town will meet at the Town Hall
for the purpose of nominating candidates

and hroo Councillors We have been
requested 0 aunounco that on that
ocousion a slatement of tho Finanecinl
affairs of the Town will be presented by
the Reeve nnd it is hoped there will bo a
large attendance of electors We believe
the only candidates now in the field are
for Reove Messrs Twomey and Thomas 
for DeputyReeve Messrs Dunbar and
McGee  and for Councillors Messrs
Brett  Morin Robidoux Kolfuge and
COadaret  We would suggest that the
various candidates for munteipal honors
be requested to state their views ns to
the encouragement they would hold out

DIVISION OF THE COUNTY

When tho news of tho division of the
County into North and South Ridings
for the election of two members fo the
Provincinl Legislature was received from
our member by telegraph lst Iriday
and announced by Ecmo extra to our
citizens there was a general expression
of satisfaction that the Government of
Ontario had dono justice to the County
of Essex in thus recognizing our claims
to incrensed represontation It will bo
seen by the speech of the Premier in an
other column that the Riding has been
divided oxactly as suggested in the first
number of the Econo and afterwards re
commended by the County and Town
ship Councils

Ministerial Party

 

Wo feel called upon to congrotulnie
the gentlomnn whose namo heads this
article nnd who hus so well reprosented
thie County of Esssex in the second Parli
ament of Ontario upon the crowning
success he has nohievod in having pro
vailed on the Government to make a
change in their bill for the redistribution
of sents nnd give an additional member
to Eusux Ilo was absent through sick
ness on tha first and second readings of
the bill and our thanks are due to Mr
Meredith of London for advoeating our
claims in Mr Princes sbsence still wo
have good ronson to know that our mem
ber was actively ongnged outside the
House in profsing the matter on the
attention of the Goverment and this
was done so cllectunlly that after his
speech in committee on the bill the
Premier consonted to roconsider the
quostion and finnlly wiped out Ningnra
and gave Lssox the sent thus placed ut
his disporal For this act alone not to
mention the Line Fence Drainage and 
other useful measures hie has promoted
and carried hrough the House Mr
Prince deserves to be again returned this
time a8 one of the members for Essex

SOUTH ESSEX

For the lust few days there hos been
considerable disussion in political circles
on the qhostion of who is to bo the first 
representative of the Sumth Riding of
Essex in the third Ontario Parliament
There is no lack of aspirants for the posi
tion sineo the County was divided and
as Conventions have been ealled by both
the Liberal and Conservative Associa
tions for next wock to choose their eand
idates they will soon be before the public
Among the names mentioned for enndid
ate of the Liberal Party the one whiely
seems to moet with most favor 9s that
of Mr Gore Afkin of Malden Mr Atkin
had considerable experience iy
municipal matters having served soveral
terms in the County Council as Reeve of
Malden and haviuz beow Warden of
the County in 1870 He is a man of
irrepronchable charzcter against whom
no one can charge a wrong and is un
iversnlly respected not only in his own
township but throughout the Riding He
is a man of independent views and will
support no Government in wrongtoing
and being an able debaterand wellinform
ed on all public questions he would be
Sura to receive o respectful hearing at
all times There is little doubt but that 
lie would accept the nomination if tend
cred to him Mr J H Morgan of Ander
don will also be brouzht before the Con
vention and as ho is well up on all pub
lic questions and has considerable time
at his disposal ho would be enabled to
devote much attention to the affairs of the
Connty Mr John  dler Reeve of
Colchester is another and as he has
been horn and brought up in the County
and thoroughly understands its wants he
would make a firstclass representative
He is very hishly estcomed wherever
known Besides these among our local
men we have heard the names of
Messrs J G Kolfige Dr Lambert and
George Russell mentioned There has
also been some reference made to Mossrs
Donald Cameron and Thomas Elliott of
Windsor but thouzl intellizent and able
men wo must take docided objection to I
any one from Windsor or any where else
outside the riding scoking to represent
us in the Halls of Parlinment ns wo have
plenty of as good and intelligont men in
our midst who better understand ow
wants thant those living in another con
stituency eanpossibly do

Among those mentioned for the can

 

lins

 

 

 

 

Wigle and Lewis Wigle of Leamington
The last of these seems to be the most
prominent candidate and will likely ro
coivp the Conservative nomination but 
although he is a very pushing and suc
cessful business man and las
many  worthy and estimable qual
ities still there are many men
in the Riding of equal if not super
ior abilities who have far greater claims
to the Representation of the constituency
in the Provincial Parliament Among 
other names mentioned are those of Mr
M Twomey of this town and Col Rankin
ond Mr A Cameron of Windsor


NORTH ESSEX

Thore is now no question but that Mr
Princo will receive the unanimous nom 
ination of the Ministerial Party for tha
North Riding Thero is some talk of
opposition to him and should any one be
brought out it will Likely bo Mr Jamies
C Patterson tho prosent Deputy Reeve
of Windsor although tho names of
Mossrs Gibson and Forme have heen
mentioned Had Mr Prince not been in
the field Mr Donald Cameron the
Mayor of Windsor would without doubt
have recived the nomination of the

ReDistribution Debate

On Tharsday of Inst week in the Com
mittee on the ReDisiribution Bill on
thie 17th Clause

Mr Mowat said that in rogard to the
cloctornl district of Niagara he belioved
every one admitted that it was impossible
to retain that constituency us it now
stood Ib contained a population of only
3608not much more than half of the
coustibumey of Cornwall and consider
ablo loss than half the population of
Brockville The fact that in England
hero were great inequalities was no
justifieation for qhoir oxisting in this
country Those inequalitios there were
a blot upon the electornl system and the
tendency was towards diminishing them
Le bad flt very groat difhieulty in decid
ing on the best munuer of denling with

the constitnency of Ningara If the
towndhip of Granfham in adjoined

Ningara wero taken from Lincoln the
rosult would be that the population of the
riding would aniount 10 15000 or 16000
leaving only 8000 or 9000 in the West
ern Riding Such an arrangdment could
not be defended Another alternative
was to take Stamford from Welland
but Lio had always regarded that us un
suomaly He Lind only made the pro
posal under the assswuption that it
would be acceptable to all the parties 
but it wns not acceptable and he thought
tho House conld not throw such an ar
rangement upon a constituency which did
uot concur in it Thore was no other
alteruntivo excopt to add Niagara to
Lincoln Then there was gu member loft
at the disposal of thie House The conuty
of Bssox was tho Jargest connty whieh
returned only one woember having a
population Ly the last consus of 2 697

 HZ
while the next county Halton had
32606

He proposed fo divide Essox
intotwo ridings by drawing a straivht
line through the county 80 as to make
a North and South Riding There was
no political object in tho proposal which
would strhgthen the member for Lincoln
and gave another member to the largest
county now retwruinz only ona ropresen
tative There was sno such reason for
interfering with Cornwall which had a
population of 7114 and which was n
progressive town which Tio was sorry to
say Ningarn was not If the member
wero taken from Cornwall there wins
no other eastern county to which they
could give a member and seeing that all
the now members wore going to the west
he was sure no one world desire to
deprive the eastern part of the province
of one of its roprosontatives Essex
they proposed to divide into a North
Riding with a population of 17988 and
a South Riding with 14709 The re
solution which he moved was to insert
