George asked with a longing look in his
great blue eyes 

The mothers lips quivered tenrs filled

Mary Grayson stole quictly out while

Willie bounded to the window A

moments Mr Anstin said

Mrs Austin in a tone of rogrot

Too late mow too comfort one of

  Pian 
window where their little neighbors used
to sit ind wondered for svhich tie coflin
was

Mys Austins pleasure was marred or
A glent yopret wus in her heart Con
stantly came the thought

If I only had remembered those poor
little ones 1 

Tis never too Inte to do right and

 Tell me more of them

The little fellow told me that his papa

Bre Willie had finished lis story Uncle
Charley was crossing the sireet to the
gront astonishment of his sister and
brotheriulnw

Two hours passed before he roturmad
Then he told thom thatthe father of these
little ones was his dearest friend  that
Lis yeturn biome was principally to find
George Graysons widow and children
and bear to thom the little fortune Lie had
made
 And T must pay to those Le loved the
debt of gragitnde I owed to him said
UncleClinrlay  He nursed me through
tht fever and when all others pronouno
od me dead he still worked on and with
Gods blessing saved me

And Lis loved ones so near meand so

said Mrs Austin

And when her brother told more of
those little ones partienlarly of the only
Christan ft which came to little Muy
the Christmas wreath that Geare had
given herand wl

regret for her noplect 

 

   

 

 

Oh I wish I had sent them romo

muke a little more comfortabla the last
days of that little ones life But I forgot

And wlien constantly came the thouzht

Impossible  you say how dig sno hin

worked out of doors that ele also had a

Matehed Against Death

The announcement of the denth of John
Mackey of Windsor will surprise only
those who had not heard of his
illness  The expugilist and extrniner
and exhotel keeper passed away Sunday
after n longcontested fight with death
which always wing the vietory over man
Mackey wns not a bad man when one came
to read him thorouglily When bis early
ngsocintions are considered it was perhaps
no wonder that hie adopted prize fighting
os a business when he grew to manhood
Ho went to Detroit many yeirs ago
firmly resolved to fight no more and he
kept his resolutfon to the cnd
He gave adviep and he acted 88 trainer
but no challenge could force iim into the
ving after he had resolved to guit it

There were times when the reporters
ised to sit down with the brenzed veter
an of the ring and question Jim and listen
to the narration of his bouts with this
and that pugilist and at sul times his
eyes would take on a new lizhty his mus
cles would work and for the moment he
would imagine himself again standing face
to face with some bruiser ncither asking
for favor nor giving quarter

He kifew he had to die and he made
his preparations It wasnt a fair mnsteh
but ho made a braye fight living two gr
three days after the physicinn said he
was a dying mon He conldnt put up
and strike out with his let and then
Yeot away from  punishment Death
was principal stakeholder referee and
second yet the expugilist had a will of
iron and he held out like a rock His
illness had Leen brief and the great
muscles had not wasted away nor the
brawny hand grown thin To see him
fighting death was sad yet there was
gomething in the at which men of Lis
stamp admired and thoy mid among
themnselveg  It he had n fair show
hed not make ten rounds of it

The fight drew to a close at last and
 time was nothing more to the exbruis
cr  ITis heavy hand grew cold nnd the
mighty muscle was still Then men
whispered  

 Worse men will live after him
