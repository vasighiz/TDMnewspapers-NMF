forgive you the f
yon gave me

Santa Well friend W I think I can make
it all right and yon will sce I have been
studying your interest throughout I thought
1 would supply all the  small fry first and
then when they had mado all the noise and
show they were capable of I would bring you
all those wonderful things that I have been
80 far4o callect for your especial benefit from
Paris London Pekin Timbuctoo and other
parts of the Union so that you will now be
able to do things upin n fashion Amherst
burg will never forget But however well
to business First of all how do yeu like the
Books I heard that since the arrival of the
Eco the good people of Amherstburg have
commenced to go in for literatare and liter
ary institutions pretty heavily so I thought I
would spare no pains to geoure you a good
stock of firstclass reading matter to give
them a start

W A WMany thanks Santa yon eould
not have done mo a greater service It is true
that my intelligent fellow townsmen are
making a great start in the parsuit of know
ledge just now and my only fear is that my
stock will not prove half extensive enough

SantaIndeed Im glad to hear you say
80 and I will tell you that it was only ow
ing to the grent regard I have for you that
I was able to get safo over with them at all
As 1 was crossing the Ocenn in my Balloon I
came upon a lurge party of scientific fellows
returning from o visit to the Transit of
Venus if yon know who he is I dont but
Ive seen his name a good deal in the paper
lately  I kinder guess he must be the
party thats going to do U 8 Grant out
of his third term Anyhow I met them and
thoy commencod overhauling my purchases
and were 80 delighted with my scientific and
other books that they would have approprint
ed them one and all had I not thrown over
some more ballast and given them the slip

IV 4 WWell Santa Im glad you didnt
lot them  come it over you in that fashion
But where on earth did you get those wond
erful Cycloscopes from They have com
pletely puzzled us all and f are begin
ning to credit me with denlings with the own
er of a worse pair of claws than ever you
boasted of Santa old fellow

 SantaAh ha I thought I should aston
ish you I happened to be in Austria at the
time the Polar Expedition was being fitted
out and in course of conversation with dif
ferent members of the staff I found that one
great difionlty experienced by former ex
plorers was oceasioned hy the Polar Bears
who would keep sticking their paws and
noses in front of the Telescopes and prevent
any correct view being taken of the apex of
the Polar gyratieal  sa 1 set to work and in
vented this machine which is capable of
conducting the vision through the thickest
head tlint ever fancied it was fitted with
glass and as soon as I have realized my pro

fits I intend to scll the Patent and retire
from business dh

IV 4 IWDont say hat Santa What
will becomo of me if youdo that

SantaOh never four I will ind some
means of supplying yon when Xmas comes
round again Bye the bye is there much
sparking going on round Amherstburg just
now  3  

WW A WNow yours shouting Santa
ond I am pleased to find that you have not
neglected our dovoted rien but have

ight

brought me ronnd a splendid assortment of

Dressing Cnses Work Boxes Jewel Cases
Writing Desks Albums Pictures Mirrors
Toilet Seta and sweethearting and wedding

esents of all descriptions Yes Santa youn

ve done well I have everything here to
bring about many a happy union this sen
son barring the certificates and

SantaHold there boy dont be too
greedy and want all for yourself How about
those notices in Mr Templetons window
next door  No no dont you earyou find
the presents and hell find the licenses

W A WVery well friend Santa Ill
leave tho fees to him nnd set myself to strik
ing matches and if they dont gooff prot
ty freely it will be no fault of yours and
mine Santa 80 have a cigar of which I have
some splendid brands that I am certain will
please you and after that we will turn in
as I have to be up early to open tho rest of
the cases

SantaYesI think youre right for bless
od if that old Yoregt didnt cmp me
up and I kind o fi 0 effects innards
But boforo going I want you to take this
message to all my friends old and young in
Amherstburg Tell them that Santa Claus

THE LOCAL HOUSE

The plan of holding two sessions each
day with a view to the conclusion of the
business this week wai adopted by the
Legislative Assembly on Monday As
members have thus been enabled to have
measures advanced two stages in a day
since if ordinary industry has been
evince the session should be brought to
close by Saturday Members will thus
be enabled to get home before Christ
mas It is now understood that the
writs for a general elootion will be issued
immediately after the New Year foturn
able about the 20th of January so that
wo will witness the termination of the
election struggle in a little over a
months time There are very few coun
ties in which both Liberals and Conser
vatives have not chosen their candidates

In Essex no formal nominations have
yet been made but we expect both Lib
eral and Conservative conventions will
bb held in a few days to nominate their
candidates Albert Prince Esq MP

THE COUNCIL FOR 1875

There has boen considerable discussion
about our municipal elections in town
the past week and various names have
boen suggested for the different tickets
which it is proposed to run for members
of the Town Council for 1876 We be
lieve all the old Council will again enter

tho fleld Mr Twomey is to have an op  b

ponent for the Reeveship in the person
of Mr C W Thomas  Mr Dunbar will
likely be opposed by Mr S McGee and
Mr A Bailey isalsoa

Council The names given nbove are
likely all that will go to the polls and
probably one or two of them will drop
out before election day Wa believe the
usunl explanations of the affairs of the
Town will be given by the present Reeve
on Nomination day but it has been sug
gested that it would be advisable to call
o public meeting of electors some time
noxt week in order tq obtain the views
of the various candidates an the situation


thay had Jearned that thowo hod

since the census was taken
venture to say that no county of the Pro
vinoe has nde more raph advances then
the County of Essex since the consus of

1871 and that if it is probable that Com

wall will haye a population of 16000 at
next consusas Mr Bethune promised om
the debate on the continuance of that

riding it is just ns probable that Mssex
will have a population of 60000 Mr
Prince waa abgent owing no doubt to
illness a8 we aye informed that le hns
been very unwell of late

Mr Meredith of London took part in
the debate and said ho was in Eels of
the readjustment of the constituencies 
he did not believe in vested rights and
held that the representation should be af
certain times 80 adjusted ns to equinlize
the number of elecors in ench constitn

The t wan i

to Jrinciple that representation hy
population should be the lasis of the
seadjustment Essex with a population
of 83000 had but one member while
there were not less than six constituencies
in the Province containing a less populn
tionNorfolk Brant Wentworth Vic
toria Peterboro and Renfrew that had
two members each That bill therefore
did injustice to the County of Essox
which was ono of the most rapidly in
greasing counties in the Province

On Tuesday the Houde went into com
mittee on this Lill and several clauses
were passed but clauses 78 912 and 17
relating to the ridings of Cardwell Grey
Wellington Simcoe and Niazara were
allowed to stand over

Mr Prince said thre was no com
plaint made respecting the redistribution
acheme as a whole but it would be rend
ered most complete by the addition of
another clauge It wasnot thought de
sirable that the House should contain
more members nevertheless a large
number of petitions had been submitted
to the House from the County of Essex
asking for more than one member to ro
present ita population of 88000 inhabi
tants The County consisted of thirteen
municipalities eleven of which were large
jo nsliing The bill of the Government

nd precluded Essox from making an ad
dition to its territory and that was an
argument why it should have an addition
al member because by th operation of
the measure it was prevented from mak
ing a slight extension which would give
it the few thousand additional inhabitants
necessary to give it an additional mem
ber under the rule adopted by the Goy
emment The arguments set forth in
the Essex petition sliowed that its case

wns a peculiar one and the Govern
ment would be doing a gracious act in
assenting to the prayer of the petitioners
He moved in amendment the addition of
a olanze providing for the division of the
County into North and South Ridings
giving a represntative to each

Mr Mowat replied thet the motion
was incongistent with those portions of
the bill already passed which set forth
the number of members and their seats
He was however freo to ndmit that Es
seX ocoupied the position of having the
next best claim to another member The
lino must be drawn somewhere and it
80 happened thatEssex was just below the
line Ningara were thrown into the
County of Lincolu there would be a
spare sont which might be given to Essex

 hoped themotion would be withdrawn
for the present 

The motion was then temporarily
withdrawn and the remaining clanses
earried after which the committee rose
and reported 

At o subsequent session on Tuesday
the 7th 8th nnd 9th clauses were passed
in committee and Mr Mowat offered
some explanations in regard to the olec
toral arrangement in respect to Niagara
He expressed himself ns unable to state
what proposition he would submit to
the House for he had not yet made up his
mind on the subject There were objections
both to taking n portion of territory awny
from Welland and uniting it with Niagara
and to throwing Niagara into the County
of Lincoln He would on Wednesday
announce the arrangement to be adopted

We can certainly see no injustice in
throwing Niagara into the County of Lid
colnwhich would then have a populatibn
of only about 24000 and the Ningpra
District would still have four members in
the House
