curried in mails valuable packages of
 velvets silks gloves and Nimilar art

icles daily arrive in Bangor in the

mails from the province of New Bruns
 Wick in transitu to more interior
ints and which are conveyed on the
 North American Railway
 The collector inquires whether an offi
if cer of the customs whon upon the
 cars carrying mails discovers in the
8 mails or postal car packages which he
has reason to believe are being smug
ged is authorized Ly any law to seize
em The Treas Department in
forms tho collector that under no oir
eumstances is an officer of the customs
 outhorized to seize or detain pdckagen
conveyed in mails or postal ears under
charge of persons empowered to
