The Detroit Free Press speaking of our

Province having been behind the mother

The Welland Canal

 

Wo obgerve that advertisements have
been published oplling for tendars for the
completion of the works on the Welland
Canal We understand that while the
depth of twelve feet is to be adhered to

 

on all the locks and the intervening levels 

the Linrbors of Port Colliorne and Port
Dallionsio will be deepened to sixteen
foot 80 as to afford a fourteen tect nyvi
gation at lowest water when the es
shall have been deepened toythiat eapn
Tho guard locks at each end will also
mde shit the fourteon foot navi
gation It is futher led that oo new
aqueditet for the W iver shadl be
built The present aqueduct can Lo and
will be deepened to twelve foot hut it
will be imp b to get ue greater depth
than that 1 of water
which the aq woy whi
vessels tre haseing through would bo in
wdoquate for tie wana of navigation
The new aqueduct will be built along
side of aud will be considerably wides
than e ug one snd will be arranged so
ak to  fourteen fect navigntion
The lacks on the long descent from Thor
old to St Catharines will have but twelve
feet of navigable depth but in that cage
the additioal two feet of capacity can
be added by simply raising the wails and
ombankments to that extent
thus adopted will enable the Government
to prosecute with all vigour the works of
construction now under contract which of
course haye primarily in view tho soeur
ing of twelve fect of navigation while at
the same time the prepnration for a four
tepn feet system throughout which we
have indicated ns beipg nado at bothrends
and in connection with theaguednet will
permit the necessary change being mado
at a future day at comparatively small
expense without loss of timeand with no
inconvenience to the navigation of the
canal There is this also to be raid in
favor of the arrangement made by the
Goverhmentthat the contry will Lave
the advantage of the new canal nt lenst
a year and a Lindf earlier than if thy had
to wait for its completion on the fourteen
foot system  An arrangement has been
made between the Government and the
Great Western Railway Company by
whicli thie railwsy will diverge somevlint
from ifs present course and pass under
the instead of over it ns it does now
thus saying all the annoyanos connected
with a swing bridge which frequently in
tercepts the navigation and isbesides
liable to accidents Liberal

of Kesnx at the Assizes now being held
at Bundwich beg lenve to present to
your Lordship that we have disposed of
all the cases brought before us Wao re
gret that there are so wany crimes of a
serious nature om the docket but we
hope in the future this will prove to le

an oxcoptionnl stato of things in this

county We have visited the gaol and
found no complaints from the priconers 
they expressed themselves quite satisfied
with their trentinent  we Sy every
thing clean and great piaiso is duo to Mr
Leiteh the guoler for the admirable man
ner in which the gaol is manned

ally in the cane off the 

attention to We fe Uimt tite underdrains
from the cosspoiLinre quite inadequate
for the proper ventilation of the gaol the
odor from the sume being very unpleas
ont and highly jujuvions tothe health of
the prisoners and also of the officials in
 the Court House Wo desire to call par
ticular attention to this us we believe
former Grand Juries have fund the
snire fault and have enlled attention
thereto but those having the mannge
mont of such matters seem to fail in

vise hut the proper authoritios should
take the matter into their serious cons
sideration I devise at once the propor
menns for draining tho said casspouls No
mutter ot what cost this should be done
without delwy
