1 sprang ta the door that separated the
siltiugroom fram the dining upartments
and saw tho whole at  glance The
yong mother stood at the door with
lier firstboxnour darling Blossom in
Jier nrms dying  A fow briefund hun ied
words from tho servant told the Audstory
The little girl hed accompunied nn clild
unelo upsteirs sud while the attcution
of the older child was for wx moment
turned away she seized u bottle of cor
yosive sublimate in nleohol and had
drank enough to buve taken nway twenty
such lives The little thing hind toftered
down stairs and her mother Lad et
her at the landing with the ompty bottle
in her laud and the poison cozing from
her nivuththe child all uncouscious of
the fearful thing sho had done Was it
nny wonder that agterrille rhirick rang
out over the quiet village and Lat al
rondy tha occupants of every hiocuse near
were rushing towrd the spot where the
mother gtood  

But o few moments could possibly
have elapsed since the paison was taken
and yet the effect was already fearful
After the first shrick of terror the motli
er lind quicted ton colm despair for tho
moment and stood with the childin her
armas making no effort for its relief and
i 1deed it spemcd higpeless for alread
the subtle poison seemed diffused through
the frame the brown eyes had lost their
lustre  and the face was blackened ns if

after death  nud the teeth were tizlit set
ina convulsive spusm that evidently
would uot pass away Iesumived the
hiftle lost darling for a moment saw that
it was hopeless and then turned away
unable to bear a mothers agony The
little door was already  Ludffilled with
willngers  and sobs and monns and la
mentations over the fate of the dying
child wes heard in every direction
mingled with quick and huriiedjustions
us to the manner of its occurrence and
vuln attempts at answering which added
an oppressing confugion to the sadiess of
ike scene

The little playfellows uncle who Lad
been upstairs with the child lind run
instantly to call the father andbut o few

tho middle of the group Ie lind bLoen
told all und nsked no questions I lad
time to remark that bis cye was very

stern and that Lis lips were very finnly
compressed Others too ramnried ib
aud I knew afterword that a murmur
ran around the circle of how strange it
was that he betrayed no focling

He roached out Lis hands and took tlie
child from its mather Its cyes were
now closed and a white  ooze coming
from between the blackened lips Was
ever death fuore assured I saw lim
open tho dyelids and give asizh of relief
He told me afterward that th eye was
not sunken nnd so dnth had not Vs
Ho then attempted to oped the month
but the teeth were tight sel and they re
sifted lis cfforts But with a force that
seemed nlmost brutal he wrenclied the
teoth apart and opened the mouth

Shame cried one of the bystanders

The fatlicr did not heed them but mo

tioned to a neighbor to take the child in
his arms He did so

 Dring me the eggbasket he spoke
very sternly almost without opening Lix
 tecth to the servant
 What do you want of it 2 What
can you do with it Hes crazy and
many such remarks followed but the bus
ket was there in a moment

He seized one of tho eggs broke it in
serted his fingers aguin between tho teeth
und wrenched them open by force
though they shut with so convulsive a
motion asto tear the flesh from lis fin
gers and poured the albumen into the
throat There was o slight strugele
nothing more and the spectators were

horrified ut the action

 Doit the child is dying said one
Please dont hurt the little thingit

cant live I the mother found voice to
say laying her hand upon his arm

Mary be still he answered sternly
while lus teeth were unrelaxing from
their clenching and his face as hard as if
lie were entering o battlo and dont any
of you meddle with me  keep off I

The bystanders involuntarily obeyed
with many barsh remorks upon his cruel
ty but ho did not hiced them and went on
Another and another egg wus broken and
till there was no sign of life Then the

whole body of bystanders broke out into a
Jond munnur and cries of The brute
Alat tho child die in peace 1 He in

acxazy take the child away from Lim 
wero hoard around hiw 

H dexisted for n moment from his ef
forts and turned with a fierceness which
had before bocn foreign to his nature but
no one who iw bim afterward forgot it
Fools he hissed mind your own busi
ness and leave mo to mine Toko her
awny will yon T it and he wont on

The mother could stand this no longer
Hor firstborn was being tortured to denth
before lier eyes and she imploringly
flang herself on ber knees before her hua
