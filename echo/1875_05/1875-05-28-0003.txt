London in Danger of Rats

Yno I
1 guess Id botter take pork

In a few years time unless somo active
measures are taken London may expect
great trouble from rats It is a startling
fuct that one pair of rats with their pro
geny will produce in three years no less
n numbef than 846808 A doe rat will
have from six to cight nests of young each
year for four years together and from
twelve to twentythree at o litter  and
the young does will breed at three
months old and here are more fomales
than males at an average of about ten to
six If they ran sbout the strects like
cats and dogs the public would be terrified
but ns they hide and work in the dark
men seldom see or think of them Brick
drains are their chosen hnunts  skirting
boards backs of fire places under the
flooring or betweon the rafters are their
places for breeding The London swer
men state that brick drains are the rats
best friends and that nothing but glazed
pipes with heavy sink traps will stop the
sewer rats gotting into houses They will
not go up gates for the fedr of being
drowned knowing they have no means of
escape Thoy are seen in the sewers mi
grating in communities to some discoy
ered quarter for food and the sewermon

believe that they have n language of their
own

 
VecrTanLe Instinct If a pail of wa
