 Mu who Inwiully o gular tha
7 abovew ation being seven foot y
und made in proportion His prowess

wis well known and there was one thing
tat grieved Barney above a little name
 ly  That he could get nobody who was
uble 5 stand before bi in his own Pana
 Now 0 of a certain giau
fos a laboring under the
 Yke grief and from precisely the same
oases Therefore Barney after consult
ing hin friends on the subject sent a
chullengo to the Scotch giant to come
over to lrelnd and get the sousait taken
out of himself After due time the
 bearer of the challange returned with
word that it had been accepted and fur
thor stated that he had better make his
will get his coffin made elo a8 he that
ho was to encounter never loft hin work
half done 

DK you geo lim 2 asked Barney
fith an 1 did eaid the messenger

i What is he like interrogated the
 giant
 Faith Barney avie hoslike anything
t all but a mortal being
Tlow big is he  suid Barney locking

but illplensod nt the desoription of his
vival 

 How big is he did you ray Faix 
 hes an big ns the old tower forninst the
door mn a head an shoulders on him

counts hell ait you alive 

Barney begun to feel rather ansomfor
table at tho prospect before Lim and
straightway wont to consult his wif6 as to
what slhionld be done in the event of his
rival proving to le such as his messenger
had represented While they were thus
engaged one of the children came running
in aud excluimed   Duddy  como to the
doar an gee the great man thats coming
up tho hill Burney peepod through the
chinks of the door and to his great terror
saw the monster 

 One look was enough to satisfy him
that his messenger had not exngfrorated

wife he said 

 Shelah jewel Im eat up alive for
sarlin Hero comes the Scotch baistto
drum your Barney 

When Shelah heard of the approach of
the coming foe and saw her lords in
nbility to wage war with one so for super
jor in strength and size she concluded
that it was only by some piece of wotanns
wit that her husband could escipo from
the affair without dishonor According
ly she gently lifted the child out of the
3 cradle and depositing itin the innerroom
made the father get in its place and
covering him up with a quilt gently seat
od herself and resumed her work After
a few moments in walked the cause of all
the disturbance nnd demanded an inter
view with the giant Shelah after
motioning with her hand for him to keep
quict walked gently across thefloor to
where he stood and in an undertone told
him Barney had gone out to the woods
The giant told her that he intended wait
ing his return

Very well eaid Shelah uy dont
make a word of noise for the life thats in
you for theres nothing makes him more
farious than to hear the child crying when
he comes home

By this timethe ginnt hnd seated him
elf on a bench and was quietly surveying
the apartment  but when his cys vested
on the oradle with a look of unutterable
sto xishment he asked What was in it

Init eried Shelah  Dont you
sco its the child thats init An heaven
help you if you Wake him the crayture
didnt get a wink of sleep last night with
two back teeth hes cutting

The giant avith avlook af terror and
asfonishment asked what size tlie father
Was

 Faith an I eant tell you  said She
lah  caune I never measured him
But that gossoon pointing to the crad
le wlon tho father is angry runs and
hidos himself in one of his boots 1

Lnird save us oxclaimed the giant
I winna mind waiting the noo lassie 
I maun bo gaun Gude morning I

So saying he took to his heels and nev
or thouglit himself safe until he got mmong
the hills of his own country

A Petrified Goose

The Yoho Onl Mail some time before
the 1st of April told the following goose
story 
 While hunting in the tules nenr the
ink of Cacha river on Monday last an
old hunter named Abe Green discovered
ao petrified wild goose standing upright
with lege buried about onehalf in the ad
obo soil Ho thought at first it was liv
ing and creeping closely up fired his gun
atit but the bird did not budge an inch
Ho thought it strange aud walked up to
it Ho found it dead and in trying to
pick it up was astonished ut its immense
weight It had turnod to stone and a
mark on ils wing near the forward part
showed where the shot had struck it
knocking o pioce off Ho raised it out of
tho ground and when he laid it down n
piece dropped from its broast disclosing
o hollow inside from which pure clear
water commenced running Its feathers
were vory pitural aud its appearance was
calenlated to deceiveso lifelike He
took it to his cabin down the canal a
fow miles back of Washington where it
can be seen by those wHo wish to see
such a strange sod unusual sight 

A Vast Country

 

 

Canada now i8 becoming sn word to

command respect whenever it is heard
A vust Dominion extending from ocean
to ocenn with undreamed of possibilities
 of expansion and enlargement before it
is something worth logislating about and
it is strikiug to notice how thoroughly
alive to this the rising younguen of our
country are They who have been born
and educated here who have felt the full
force of our free institutions and our
rapid expansion while no less loyal to
the mother land have yot a most pecul
ior love for their native Canada and
vast confidence in her future All that
has long characterized  the people of the
United States in their boundless faith in
the possibilities of their land is charac
terizing the young Canadian statesman
of the prosent dny and it is  healthy
sign that it should be So There is am
plo verge androdm enough fir a large
ambition here We have legislated this
session for the government of territories
in the NorthWest almost 0s large as the
wholk of Europe We have concluded a
treaty by which quiet possession of lands
is secured to the settlers therein at the
 same time that justice is done to the In
dion ribes that have hitherto been the
only lords of the plains We have taken
Ateps for the prosecution of that vast
railway work which is to bind together
all the links in our great Provinces and
oper up the way for millions of free pao
plo to spread thiemsolves over the centre
of the continent  and although the Sen
ate in the exercise of its wisdom roject
ed a measure binding Canada to a specific
yearly expendituro on the most distaut
link fu this chain yet the main work and
the main object cannut and will not be
lost sight of We have too amended
our Militia and Defence actstaking
another step in the path of solfrelinnce
and selfgovernment The mother cain
