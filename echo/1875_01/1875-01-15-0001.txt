first meetings of the newly elected Mun
icipul Conneils namely  the third Mon

 day of the same January in which they

are elected  und it was regarded as a
very unfortunate oversight that the poll

for the same day Ou looing at the
Statute however the difficulty oan be
very enaily got over by such of the Conn
cils ns do notwislli to meet on that day
there being added to tho quotation nbove
given the words or on some day there
after It will thon be quite lawful for
Township or Village Councils to hold
their first meetings  on some day after
the third Monday so that we presume
all that will be necessary will bo for the
Reeve ta instruct the Clerk to eall the
meeting fur any day after the third Mon

Col Rankin had had the pleasure of
hearing Mr Wigle at Amherstburg when

today Ho had sometimes worked with
the Reformers and had obtained a mons

choose him to run against Jolin OConnor

him to accomplish their purposes and he
had used them to Mal his ends
