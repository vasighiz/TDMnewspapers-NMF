 ing for candidates to represent them in

i



tho Logislutive Aseinbly and as the new
system of voting by ballot will then
come into play a synopsis of the prinei
pal fontures of the et tuny not be unin
torosting to those who have not yet had
an opportunity of studying its provis
ions

Seotion 1 provides that in case a poll is
demanded in any such Election the votes
shall be given by ballot Section 2 pro
vides for the furnishing of ballot boxes to
the different deputyreturning officers 
provides how they are to be made and
that they shall be furnished with lock

not withdrawn till the box is unlocked
They are to be delivered to the officers at

and to be returned to the Clerk of the
municipality within one week after the
close of the election  and shall be kept
by such Clerk and preserved by him for
use at future elestions By Section d it
is provided that where poll has been

The mode by which the olector shall
indiento the onndidnte he votes for is by
placing a mark or cross opposite the
the eandidiles name asin the form above
given Tho higlot paper is to be fuld
ed in such i way as to concenl the names

In cases wliore a voter is unable from
blindness or yy ather physic canse to
mark his ballot paper then whic DepRe
turning officer shall cause the Vote to lin
anrked on the ballot paper if the mun
ner the voter may direct and place it in

not to take their ballot papers out of the
olliug place  if they do they shall for
Rit their vote should any decline to

These are the principal prod isions of

tho new lw authorizing voting by ballot
so fur as the voters are concerpod The
proyisions regulating the conduft of the
Returning officers and their depitties we
do not think it necessary to give na hese

will bo provided with copies of the Act
