Mr Twomey further said they had
bought two debentures of the Canada
Southern at 90 There was a bolance
of 1810 due the County for County
purposes for some yenrs past but as the
county had already received 5000 mote
from the town than they were entitled to
he should oppose paying it if he were
Reeve fof 20 yenrs

Myr C W Thomas in nccopting the
nomination for Reeve of the Town did
not intend to make n speech He was
us munch Speed a8 Mr Twomey was
to paying the 1800 due the County
and lind entered a protest in the Council
against it When Deputy Reeve he had
dono his utmost to get the Assessmenb of
the town reduced for County purposes
and had succeeded in bringing it down
from 235000 to 190000 In the first
oar of Mr Twomcys Rooveilip they
had raised the assessment again and last

your they had brought it back to 225

000 and this waz brought about by

Mr Twomoys assisting to raise that

of Windsor when they retaliated on

Amherstburg Ho must admit that the

town wos sadly out of repair when Mr

Twomey became Roeve and Le had

carried out many necessary improve

ments but tha previous Council had left
them in n position to carry out these
improvomente Ho however complained
of over 127M being spent on local
improvements Sl we only had the side
walks the Richrifgnd Street drain the

Cometery fence ant w otherimprove

ments If olected he should reduce the

local expenses 08 low as possible and if
ho spent 6000 next yoarhie would show
more for it

Mr Twomoy aid that Mr Thomas
was misinformed us to his going ngoinst
Windsor because ho had always voted
with Windscr and had only gone for
raising Windsors assessment on the cgi
sont of Mr McGregor The rural Mun
icipalities had gone against Amherstburg
in spite of both Windsor aud the ropre
sentatives of this town

Mr S McGeo had thought Mr
Dunbar was not going to run for
Deputy Rocve this year and that was
ono of the reasons why ho was in the field
MrAlanson Elliott had told Lim that Mr
Twomey modo the motion to raise
Windsors ssseasment

Mr Twomey desired to explain that
Mr McGregor consented or ho would not
have made the motion

Mr MoGeo thought nevertheless it
was bad poliey on Mr Twomeys part
in making this motion He also thonght
tho nmount that had been expended for

 Local purposes was too large and that
 moneys of other funds had been used for
local purposes The town had obtained
over 6700 from other sources They
should have nonrly 2000 now in the
bank on account of the Canada Sothern
Railway sinking fund but he saw no
motion of fe re was nlso 1600

i annually for gravel rond N
aud he would ke to know whathaq boon
done with something like 2000 thoy
should now hoye on hand for the gravel
rood sinking fund Thoy wero colloctin
monoy unjustly when they collected
it for the gravel round and oxpended is for

other or pa Ho bad boon informed
that they had beon making sidewalks in
the back of the town with old planks
which they Fupbsed good enongh for
that part of the town Another thing ho
wa op to was the Richmond sow
or whith had cost nearly one dollar a
foot when a brick sewer could have been

lnced there at 9185 per foot The plac

ng of that box up Richmond stroet was
esusurable That Richmond street had
cost the town nearly 7000

A VoiooIt is tho best streot in tho
fown  L

Ho would venture to say thatin five
yours that sower would bo blocked up
ns it would bo worn out If olected ns
Deputy Reeve ho would endeavor to
spend their money judicioualy

Mr Twomey hoped that Mr MoGoos

ostications would not all some true
na the Richmond street drain ought to
Inst ton years st least He thought tho
taking up of debentures of the Southern at
tter than leaving the money in
the bank at a miserable per cant interest

Mr MeGoo anid the debentures of the
Southern had been taken up with the
Municipal Lomn Fund Grawt He did
not object to taking up debentures when
they could bo bought below par He
condemned tho digging of a ditch
through the Asylum grounds in the mon
ner in which if had been done by the
Council

Mr P Nevin as o ratopayer of the
town desired to spenk o few words in
favor of the present Council and espeo
inlly the Reeve who had done much at
the Council board to advance our best
intercsta When the Reeve and present
Council had come into office thoy lad
gone enorgotically to work to repair our

ilapidated sidewalks and now we could

walk the streets without being in danger
of having our necks broken The more
improvemonts the town gets the more
our property will be worth and therefore
wo liad no Just xeason toeomplain if we
lind to pay o little more to have our town
placed ino proper condition It was im
possible to plenso everybody nnd he hop
ed they would view tho actions of a oh
lie Voir in n broad light It wns ncegs
sary to advance the interests of the town
to offer inducements to manufacturers to
loente here ns the present council had
done As to the sewer on Richmond
Street it would be of much service in
draining the back part of the town and
had been built at the lowest possible rate
He had heard gentlemen get up nnd talk
about future prospects but he would like
to know what thoy had done with the
public money when they were in office
during three or four years beforo the
proseut council wero selected He would
eave them to their own gdod judgment
and hoped they would retain tho present
ao in office till they proved them
selves unworthy

Mr Adams said that a colored gentle
man had offered to build the drain much
loss than the contractor had done it for

Mr Twomey said that MrD esjardins
contract was in a lump sum and it cost
much less to build it under his contract
than it would have cost under Mr
Turners offer to do it by the yard The
surveyor had mnde o mistake in the
specifications so that there were three
times 08 many yards called for ns re
quired by the plan

Mr MoGee said that if the connecil had
advertised for tenders by the yard wlien
they found their mistake out they should
have advertised again

Mr Twomey said that it was so lato in
the senson that they had not time to call
for new tenders and they were satisfied
that the tender was very low in fuot
the contractor lost money

Sergeant Smith said a fow words in
favor of the present council and the
improvements carried out by it

Mr John Maguire also commended
the council for having built sidewalks

through the town and especially past the
Red White and Blue 

The meeting thon enmo to a close
