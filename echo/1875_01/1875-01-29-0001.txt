ciously begun last year is not to stop

eight days for entaring bribery charges

Reove of Amherstburg were nominated
for the office  Mr Twomey withdrew
and a close contest took place between
the other two resulting in the selection
of Mr Montreuil by o majority of threo
the vote being 13 for Lim to 9 for ler
The vote showed that the choice was
between the one from as the North Riding
nnd the other as from the South Riding

Resignation of Mr Snyder

We oxcoedingly regret to hear that
Mr W Snyder hos resigned the office of
General Superintendent of the Canada
Southern Railway which offico he has
 filled since August 1878 The St Thomas
Home Journal saysThe responsibility
attached to this important position and
 the peculiar circumstances which the
company and their undertaking have been
placed are enough to try nny mans soul
Peoplo have been taught both in Canada
and the United States to look for much
from the railwayfor more than probub
ly it is poseible for it ever to yield
The farmer who voted for the bonus ex
pects more on that account for the wood
he sells to the Company  the merchant
who advocated its claims lower rates of
freicht  clerzymen and newspaper
writers freo rides  the mortgage bond
holders the full and punetnal payment
of interest  and the stockholders splen
did dividends The conditions of so

much suceass aro not yet attained They
 are not within tho reach of any officer
The first requisite ia additional capital
money enough to take the road into
Chicago the distributing point of the
Great West Once there adminstrative
ability and farsivhtedness in the officers
of the Company may be looked to for n
Hnir mensure of the great success antici
pated from the line They may then be
tasked for  large 1nensure of prosperity
but nob now We are persuaded that
all things considered the Canada South
ern upon un fair examination will be
found to have done fully ns much ss
 oughit to be expected from it and com
paratively more than rival lines either
 north or south of it The rond bed has

 

thie inconvenience and discomfort oxperi
enced by nearly all who were present in
the overcrowded gathering in the Tem
perance Hull lnat Friday night Although
the Tomperance Hall is a considerable
improvement on the Town Hall in many
respeots still it is not large enough tor a
progressive plice like Amlerstburg
which being the largest town in this
District is now generally rogarded as the
headquarters of the South Riding of
Essex and which is likely to be the
scono of many maotings formerly held in
Sandwich and Windsor It therefore
becomes our duty as citizens to put forth
every offort to keep pnoo with and if
possible bein ndvanco of those surrounding
us and wo hope the members of the
Town Council will take immediate stops
towards securing the ercetion of a cons
venient publie building which will bo n
credit to the town and that they will be
heartily sustained by every rightthink
ing citizen who desires to seo Amherst
burg entirely freed from her old lethargy
ond striving to take a lending place
among the progressive towns of our
Province Wo have made considerable
advances a8 a town within thy past year
and we must not stop but still continue
to push forward in the race With a now
and commodiona Town Hall we sliould
have more lifo inspired into the town and
with ocensional visits from travelling com
ponies which we would then be sure to
have together with an incransed number
of home entertainmenly Amherstburg
inns would not be comlelled to seek
amusement away from home while
the revenue to bo derived from such a
building would more than cover the
interest on the entire outlay necossary
The amount to be oxpended in the
ercotion of n hall wonld of course require
to bo raised on debenturesoxtending over
a term of yoars say ten or mgre and
would require but a mall sum tojbo rnis
ed annually to pay off the whole amount
Wo lope whatevor notion is taken in this
matter that wo shall have a public hall
worthy of the name and ono which will
bo an ornament to the townand sufficient
for all publio purposes for somo years to
como a8 it would bo far better to do
nothing in the matter than to build one
which will be practically usoless in threo
or four years Tho sito of the present
Town Hall and ono or two other places
have boen spoken of as a loeation and

to  it would bo as well to take into consider

ation the question of a market ground
in connection with a publi building but

 these matters wo shall reserve for farther

reference in a subspquent jssye

been kept in 50 excellent a state ns to be
 the ndmiration of all who pass over it
Until the ico interfered at Amherstburg
 Inst woel trains have been run with re
 gularity Both the local and through
business of the Company have been con
 stantly increasing while the operating
expenses have been in n decreasing ratio
Notwithstanding oll this the time is not
yet come when railway men can make
 gront and brillinnt reputations operating
the Canadn Southern That time is in

 

future and it my fall to the lot of men
far less deserving of it than the men who
now enrry the responsibility upon their
shoulders in thigthe time of its severe
adversity It is not difficult to under
stand how the trying duties of his posi
tion may have become unpleasant and
irksome to Webster Suyder and how to
aman of his means relonse from them
may be fur more preferable His resig
nation hind been before the Board of Di
rectors in New York for some time but
n recent painful event of n domestic char
acter determined him fully and he urged
the immedinto acceptance by the Board
of the office which he held under them
Mr Wickes ActingPresident of the
rond came to St Thomas Inst week and
seeing no alternative accepted Mr Sny
ders resignation The nows was reosiv
ed both by the employees of the Company
and by the general public with express
fons of rogret Mr Snyder has boen n
quiet muon always in close attendance
upon his own duties and never intorfer
ing outside Without nssumption of the
dignity or selfimportance so often inei
dent to positions of power and authority
he was at nll times Kindly acoessible to
all who had business with him and he
generally sont them awny satisfied that

the Genernl Superintendent would do
his best for thom

Mr Snyder holds office only until his
successor is appointed or until the Gen
crol Manager may otherwise provide
for the discharge of the same dutios
