nominantionMossra J CG Ter J H
Morgan and T J Elliotthaving prom

comes before the electors soliciting their
suffrages ng a liberal supporter of the
Mowat Administration believing that
they Lave aeted for the very best inter

pledge himself gs a slavish supporter of
all their measures good or bud Mr At

who isnot likely to flinch from dischnrg

Mr Lewis Wigle the candidate of the
Conservative party is a man also esteem

private and public He
promises to give all measores a lib

Ly the company he keops nnd as he is
the nominee of men who have always
worked honrt and soul aguinst the present
administration there is very little doubt
where Mr Wiglo wonld be found on a
test question in the house Mr Wigle
nnd his friends are endeavoring to make

qualities

the election turn on personal consideru
tions but we are sure the electors will
not thus be misled but will consider the
great political principles nt stake nud en
dorse the honest administrution of public
affairs by Mr Mowat by voting for Mj
Goro Atkin

Two arguments and only wo ngninst
tho Mowat Administration soem to be
the wholo stockintrndo of Lewis Wigle
and hist frionds in the prosent political
contest These are first the publiention
of the quarterly Returns of Convictions
in a Government paper at a greater
price than formerly charged and second
the alldged unfair manner in which Eg
sox has Been treated in the M L Fund

platuds itis stated by My Wigle ana his
friends that the printing of the Convie

annum wheres formorly it did not cost
onehalf of that amount Now we von

of this work is 8800 it ix the fuult of the

The Government that preceded them had

D B Odette said it was the first time
he had addressed so largo and intelligent

that he camo out as a supporter of the

for Railways and being a responsible
Government had expended it in assisting
Railways to the extent of 1500000 Wa
Aid uot find tho present Government di
viding the surplus as wo had never ob
tained any of it we only had obtained
the AM L Fund settlement and they had
never divided the suvplas which hod de
