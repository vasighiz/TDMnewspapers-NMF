At tho nominition yesterday of candidntes
for your representation in the Ontario As
al were named bat only three 
geem to  mean business These wre Mr 
JL CL Patterson the opponent of he Govern
ment and Mr Loe Montrenil gad myself
both supporters of the Government

I retire from thie contest and I request all
my intended sapporters to volo for Mr
Montreuil who is now to all intents and
plErposes the Government Candidate nnd 1
veg them to consider ns carefully as 1 have

as is too often the case to bo 80 angered af
the withdrawal of the man of their choice as
to be induced to vote for his opponent

My reasons are these  The division of onr
conuty has enabled our large commanily of
FrenchCanadians to exerciso then proper and 
legitimate influence in the comueils of our 

il 1A n
French Canadinn pnd a representative man
of ir nation ond religion and Las always 
as Lis father did shiown the snmo generosity
in Lis support of those of a different nation 

Exsex French Canadinn Catholics supported
wy father for upwards of twenty years The
Goverumont of Mr Mowat is he Govern
mont which hax boon the first to recognize
this ight of oar French Canndinn efvctors
and itis dud to that Govarnment that we
shold acknowledge that fact Ly returning to
the next Parlinment a Franch Canadign and
Ido not know ou better ene than Mi Mon
trenil who has wo well served iu the Gounty
Conueil for yenry the iuterests of the County
and has had the undisputed control of our
most populous and wealthy township

Those ary my reasons for this stop I noed
hardly say to my friends how grateful I nm
for their warm sud enthinsisstic support and
Low mich more grateful I shall be if they
will transfer that support to Monsienr Lae
Montrenil 1 shonld bo ashamud of myself
i 1 ran tho risk of losing our North Riding

persona ambition to bean M PP and
this rikk I ecrtainly slionld ran i 1 alhewed
myself and Mr Montreuil to split the Guov

And so gentlemen in bidding yon farewell
