majority unexpected not ouly by the
Liberal pary but unexpected by the
Conservatives themselves who never in

much better organization than thoy had

construction of the temporary pier It is
expected that tho alip will be finished by
Sunday when we may expect a speedy
resumption of trafic Theres are now

over 1000 loaded freight ears on the sther
side awaiting transfer

We are sure the Company have the
sympathy of every ona in this serions in
terruption of what was rapidly becoming
the loading route of the couniry for pns
sengors freight and live stock and it ia

hoped they will have no more suel mis
fortunes

In the meantime however the bridge
and tunnel schemes and the question of
 crossing at a different point have been
rovived and discussed and it becomes tho
duty of our town authorities to be on tha
alert and to hold ont every inducement
to the company to ron he railway
through tho town and make 0 qrossing
at somo point on Bois Blane Island if

ony change in the location be
fully determined upon
