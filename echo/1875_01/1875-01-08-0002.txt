held at the Town Hall Harrow
Thursday December 81st for the Riots

of selecting a candidate to contest thi
Riding in the Liberal interest at the Fr

suing general elections for the Legialative
Asser of the Province of Ontario
Twelve oclock was the time appointed
for the meeting but long before that fully
threo hundred of the electors of the vari
ous municipalities that compose the Rid
 ing had gathered together and it is
dmitied on all hands that never had a
more enthusingtio or imfluential sssemn
Blage convened in the County of Essex

After some preliminary business the
Work was begun Tho president Mr
Samtiel McGee occupied the chair and
presided with considerable firmness and
the business was transacted expeditionsly

The minutes of previons meeting were

road by the Seerctary Mr Balfour snd
were adapted

The President invited the Hon A Me
Kellar Provincial Secretary Mr Wm
McGregor MP Col Rankin Thos J
Elliott and the Local VieePresidents
to seats on the platform

Hox A McKELIAR was then itro
duced to the electors and said that hap
pening to be in Windsor he had accepted
the invitation of Mr MeGrogor to aceom
pany him to Harrow but did not wish or
intend to use the least influence on their
choice of a candidate He was happy to
meet with them as he understood that
Reformers as well as
merly acted with the
wore to choose n nomines who would
support the Mowat administration Ho
rejoiced with them in the aequisition of n
second member by Essex as he liimself
had advoeated their clnims in the Cabinet
wellknowing that this County in pointfof
wealth extent and population was well
entitled to additional representation and
although they had not the exact number

 

of inhabitants required in cach Riding  in the interest of the South Riding

 County of Essex
nbera 

  

there were many other constitue
with a less population sending mex
Ho advised a united spiritin their delib
erations and the cordial acquiescence of
all the delegates in the 1 select
the Convention As they believe the
present Government she bo sustained
thoy shoukl work heartily for thelr caudi
duje to secure hig election He referred
fo Ale actions of the Mowat Administra
tion of which he wns a member

   

 

   

  

the charge of the Opposition that they
had squandered the public moneys sid

thot they had a very insignific
plus he would inform them the
doubt they all knew that the Province
had a sum total in surplns aad invest
ments of 9000000 and if every linbi
lity that capi possibly come against th
country were provided for they would
still have over 5000000 of good sound
cash in tho Trensury He was not ono
who belioved in hoarding up tl
money at a miserable 5 por cent

000she was entitled tomore consideration 
than munecipalities who had rade uo 
aitembt ta pay and had accordingly had 
this

50000 in gold in addition Their op

were still over 200000 of them tl
they could have if they could rea

and was glad to meet with them as he
had so much to do with lawyers who
wore cursed in their profession with 
of the worst and lonst t od mer

at election times Mr Cameron
Jeader of the Opposition who brought the
charge agaihst him had never returned
to the Province any of his ralary as a
Crown Minister for the time Lio was
attending to his professional duties and
yet he bogrudged the pittance the work
mon received Then as to Mr Pattison
who conducted the Mail which was his
McKellars own organ and gave him a
great deal of freo advertising still he
must expose the vagnries of that gentle
man Mr Pattison while serving tlie
country as Mr Camerons private srere
tary went away and attended to other
business but stl drew his salury from
the public chest but then Pattison con
sidered himself a sort of superior being
not to bo compared with common work
men In regard to the Agricultural firm
he would say thnt it was working well
and the only men who complainnd
were a number of byirfloss hair
worthless lawyers His timo
permit him to autor into thet q
day but he soon hoped to have ano
unity of addressing them on this

question Finally if thers was any

 

personal or moral influence hw Govern
ment could give them they should have

it to assist them in electing their nom

inee who would no doubt be friendly to

 the Hon Mr Mowat a Cliristian Statos
