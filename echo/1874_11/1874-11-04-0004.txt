some idens  He found that the author
referred to the progress of the various de
nominations in the United States and
the especinlly marked  advance of the
Methodist Church This church made
progress not from ler wealth not from
were intelligence or culture but from her
unity of purpose and sentiment hor
principle of social equality and lier zeal

in carrying out Ler work by individual
effort If these ideas were curried ont in

the various spheres of public life there

would be more success He congratulat  C

ed the chairman on the palpable evidence

The Rev W 8 Griffin the Booietys
Agent addressed the meeting He re
ferred to the numerous ngoncies at work
seeking to destroy the influence of the
Bible but the efforts to destroy it proved
thatit was not suchn weak thing after
all The Bible went right on caring
about as little for the frowns of its foes
a8 the favors of its friends and had
through years lived on while books on
science and kingdoms and men had
crumbled in the dust It is defendedin
the history of nations ns it lifted them

from the degradation of barbarism to the
 marvellous light of civilization

The Rev Mr Jones hoped they would
sustain the Society and incrense their
interest on it In reforence to the nt
tondance he would suggest thatin future
they publish their meetings by
means of posters which could be read by
everybody passing along the streets He

always got out bills for mission and other
meetings and found that the sum

oxpended in printers inkalways brought

him greatly increased receipts wherever
he had been

After another short address by Mr
Griffin a collection was token up and
the meeting closed
