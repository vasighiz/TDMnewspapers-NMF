were crawling about those slender fila

the streot they looked hike the delicate fiu

I walked quickly round the church
hoping to find some doorway open some
access to the interior The iron gates were
all closed the doors were fust Pauls

with its tall columns and flight of steps All

Preting ing curiously about I espied in the
angle formed by the nave and transept
en the western sido a window from which
eame tho faint gleam of a candle I stood
and looking Tetwesn the railings and saw
that someboby was moving within
There wus a birdeago in the window  on
tlio will outside some red flowerpots
Presintly somebody came to a desk near
the window and began to write an old
man with white haar

IfX could only make him seo me per
haps he would take compassion on me and
lot me in But it was not likely that he
should see me  Looking from the lighted

didt turn his head

Once again I had almost given the

this wags hillcous delusion that another

I wos now on a level with the plinth
that surmounts the great arches of the
dome  The gilded groundwork of n new
fresco in the spandrel cast o sort of glow
upon mo the colossal figures seemed to
mock my agony I inust be half wa up
now und for the moment a ray of hope
shone in upon me that I could hold on to
the end But to my dspair I now say
that the seeming dome was a filse ono
above which rose the veritable conical
roof another hundred feet or more and
that through a vast round orifice in the
shnin dome the rope was to ascend to the
uppermust peak of a roof Im that mo
