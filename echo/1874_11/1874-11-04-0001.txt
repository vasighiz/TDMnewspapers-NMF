MUNICIPAL BALLOT BILL

The Toronto correspondent of the Lon
don Advertiser says that Mr Clarks Bill
on the Ballot for municipal elections will
it is understood be adopted by the Gov
ernment and carried through but not
made applicable to the next elections as
the people could not become familiar
with its working in go short a time The
difference in qualification and the peenl
inrity in towns and cities of some parties
having votes in several wards make the
bill difficult to adjust During next year
the AttorneyGeneral will take steps
through the medium of Sheriffs andl
Clerks to get the machinery ready andl
have the Bill thoroughly explained im
time for the elections of J anuary 1876

In the House on Tuesday of this weelk
Mr Mowat moved for leave to bring ina
Bill to provide for voting by ballot im
municipal elections Cheers He said
that since last session there had been
several elections leld under the ballot
system and it had operated sosatisfnctor
ily that there was no reason why the
system should not also apply to municipal
elections Henrhear He did not intend
in this Act to provide for the identification
of voters ne he wns convinced that any
advantage gained by such identification
would be lost in the necessarily compli
ented machinery required to effect it It
was extremely desirable that a law pro
viding for municipal elections should be
as simple as possible In other respects
he had made the bill as nearly identical

ns 5 possitily with the one providing for the
ballot jn Parliamentary elections
